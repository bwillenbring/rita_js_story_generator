Capt. Tun Myat Aung leaned over the hot pavement in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, and picked up bullet casings. Nausea crept into his throat. The shells, he knew, meant that rifles had been used, real bullets fired at real people.That night, in early March, he logged on to Facebook to discover that several civilians had been killed in Yangon by soldiers of the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar's military is known. They were men in uniform, just like him.Days later, the captain, of the 77th Light Infantry Division, notorious for its massacres of civilians across Myanmar, slipped off base and deserted. He is now in hiding."I love the military so much," he said. "But the message I want to give my fellow soldiers is: If you are choosing between the country and the Tatmadaw, please choose the country."The Tatmadaw, which says it has a standing force of up to half a million men, is often portrayed as a robotic rank of warriors bred to kill. Since ousting Myanmar's civilian leadership last month, setting off nationwide protests, it has only sharpened its savage reputation, killing more than 420 people and assaulting, detaining or torturing thousands of others, according to a monitoring group.On Saturday, the deadliest day since the Feb. 1 coup, security forces killed more than 100 people, according to the United Nations. Among them were seven children, including two 13-year-old boys and a 5-year-old boy.In-depth interviews with four officers, two of whom have deserted since the coup, paint a complex picture of an institution that has thoroughly dominated Myanmar for six decades. From the moment they enter boot camp, Tatmadaw troops are taught that they are guardians of a country — and a religion — that will crumble without them.They occupy a privileged state within a state, in which soldiers live, work and socialize apart from the rest of society, imbibing an ideology that puts them far above the civilian population. The officers described being constantly monitored by their superiors, in barracks and on Facebook. A steady diet of propaganda feeds them notions of enemies at every corner, even on city streets.The cumulative effect is a bunkered worldview, in which orders to kill unarmed civilians are to be followed without question. While the soldiers say there is some dissatisfaction with the coup, they regard a wholesale breaking of ranks as unlikely. That makes more bloodshed likely in the coming days and months."Most of the soldiers are brainwashed," said a captain who is a graduate of the prestigious Defense Services Academy, Myanmar's equivalent of West Point. Like two of the others who spoke with The New York Times, his name is not being published because of the possibility of retribution; he is still on active duty."I joined the Tatmadaw to protect the country, not to fight our own people," he added. "I am so sad to see soldiers killing our own people."The Tatmadaw has been on a war footing since the country gained independence in 1948, battling communist guerrillas, ethnic insurgencies and democracy advocates forced into the jungle after military crackdowns. In the cultlike confines of the Tatmadaw, the Buddhist Bamar ethnic majority is glorified at the expense of Myanmar's many ethnic minorities, who have faced decades of military repression.The enemy can also be within. A target of the Tatmadaw's ire is Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader deposed and locked up in last month's coup. Her father, Gen. Aung San, founded the Tatmadaw.Today, the Tatmadaw's foes are again domestic, not foreign: the millions of people who have poured onto the streets for anti-coup rallies or taken part in strikes.On Saturday, which was Armed Forces Day, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief and instigator of the coup, gave a speech vowing to "protect people from all danger." As tanks and goose-stepping soldiers paraded down the broad avenues of Naypyidaw, the bunker-filled capital built by an earlier junta, security forces shot protesters and bystanders alike, with more than 40 towns seeing violence."They see protesters as criminals because if someone disobeys or protests the military, they are criminal," Captain Tun Myat Aung said. "Most soldiers have never tasted democracy for their whole lives. They are still living in the dark."Although the Tatmadaw shared some power with an elected government over the five years preceding the coup, it kept its grip on the country. It has its own conglomerates, banks, hospitals, schools, insurance agencies, stock options, mobile network and vegetable farms.The military runs television stations, publishing houses and a film industry, with rousing offerings like "Happy Land of Heroes" and "One Love, One Hundred Wars." There are Tatmadaw dance troupes, traditional music ensembles and advice columns admonishing women to dress modestly.The vast majority of officers and their families live in military compounds, their every move monitored. Since the coup, most of them have not been able to leave those complexes for more than 15 minutes without permission."I would call this situation modern slavery," said an officer who deserted after the coup. "We have to follow every order of our seniors. We cannot question if it was just or unjust."Officers' children often marry other officers' children, or the progeny of tycoons who have profited from their military connections. Often, foot soldiers breed the next generation of infantrymen. The ecosystem of the State Administration Council, as the junta that grabbed power last month calls itself, is a tangle of interconnected family trees.Even during the five years of political opening, a quarter of the seats in Parliament were reserved for men in green. They didn't mix with other lawmakers or vote as anything but a bloc. The most important government ministries remained in military hands."I am happy to be a servant to the people, but being in the military means being a servant to the leaders of the Tatmadaw," said a military doctor in Yangon. "I want to quit, but I can't. If I do, they will send me to prison. If I run away, they will torture my family members."The cloistered nature of the Tatmadaw may help to explain why its leadership underestimated the intensity of opposition to the putsch. Officers trained in psychological warfare regularly plant conspiracy theories about democracy in Facebook groups favored by soldiers, according to social media experts and one of the officers who spoke with The Times.In this paranoid world, the thumping that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy delivered to the military's proxy party in last November's elections was easily portrayed as electoral fraud.A Muslim cabal, funded by oil-rich sheikhdoms, is accused of trying to destroy the Buddhist faith of Myanmar's majority. Influential monks, who count army generals among those praying at their feet, preach that the Tatmadaw and Buddhist monkhood must unite to combat Islam.In the Tatmadaw's telling, a rapacious West could conquer Myanmar at any moment. Fear of invasion is thought to be one reason that military rulers moved the capital early in this century from Yangon, near the coast, to the landlocked plains of Naypyidaw."Now soldiers are killing people with the mind-set that they are protecting their nation from foreign intervention," said the captain on active duty. His brigade is among those that have been deployed in a city to subdue an angry populace by force.The feared invasion isn't necessarily by plane or sea, but by the "black hand" of foreign influence. George Soros, the American philanthropist and democracy advocate, stands accused in Tatmadaw circles of trying to subvert the country with piles of cash for activists and politicians. A military spokesman implied during a news conference that people protesting the coup, too, were foreign-funded.Captain Tun Myat Aung said that in his first year at the Defense Services Academy, he was shown a film that portrayed democracy activists in 1988 as frenzied animals slicing off soldiers' heads. In truth, thousands of protesters and others were killed by the Tatmadaw that year.One of Captain Tun Myat Aung's men was recently struck in the eye by a projectile from a protester's slingshot, he said. But the captain acknowledged that the casualties were remarkably lopsided in the other direction.Tatmadaw Facebook feeds may show soldiers besieged by violent protesters armed with homemade firebombs. But it is the security forces who have assaulted medics, killed children and forced bystanders to crawl in obeisance.According to the soldiers who spoke with The Times, a suspension of mobile data access over the past two weeks was aimed as much at isolating troops who were beginning to question their orders as it was at cutting off the wider population.Shortly after the coup, a few soldiers expressed solidarity with the protesters on Facebook. "The military is losing. Don't give up, people," one captain, who is now in hiding, wrote on his Facebook feed. "The truth will win in the end."The Tatmadaw's insularity serves another purpose. For decades, the military has been fighting multiple enemies on multiple fronts, mostly ethnic armed groups clamoring for autonomy. Tight esprit de corps is needed to keep desertions low and loyalty high.Casualty rates are not published in Myanmar because they are considered a state secret. But leaked documents viewed by The Times, such as a tally of fallen soldiers in western Rakhine State a few years ago, indicate that hundreds of soldiers die each year, at a minimum.The captain on active duty said it was common for unmarried soldiers to draw lots to marry the widow of one who died in battle. The woman, he said, has little choice about who her new husband will be."Most of the soldiers have been disconnected from the world, and for them the Tatmadaw is the only world," he said.Ethnic minorities, who make up roughly a third of Myanmar's population, live in fear of the Tatmadaw, which has been accused by United Nations investigators of genocidal actions, including mass rapes and executions. Such campaigns have been unleashed most notoriously against Rohingya Muslims, but they have also targeted other ethnic groups, like the Karen, the Kachin and the Rakhine.When the 77th Light Infantry Division was fighting in Shan State, in northeastern Myanmar, Captain Tun Myat Aung said he could feel the disgust of people from various ethnic groups. As a member of another ethnic minority, the Chin, he understood their fear of the Bamar majority.Although he says he shot only to wound, not to kill, Captain Tun Myat Aung spent eight years on the front lines. He developed a rapport with just one group of ethnic minority villagers during that entire time, he said."People hate soldiers for what the soldiers did to them," he said.But the Tatmadaw also saved him. His mother died when he was 10. His father drank. He was sent to a boarding school for ethnic minority students, where he excelled. At the Defense Services Academy, he studied physics and English."The military became my family," he said. "I was automatically happy when I saw my soldier's uniform."On Feb. 1, in the pre-dawn torpor of Yangon, Captain Tun Myat Aung clambered onto a military truck, half asleep, strapping on his helmet. He didn't know what was going on until a fellow soldier whispered about a coup."At that moment, I felt like I lost hope for Myanmar," he said.Days later, he saw his major holding a box of bullets — real ones, not rubber. He cried that night."I realized," he said, "that most of the soldiers see the people as the enemy."

Unrest has gripped Myanmar. Peaceful pro-democracy street demonstrations and work stoppages have given way to paramilitary operations in opposition to the country's ruthless military, which seized power in a coup d'état on Feb. 1.Military leaders' initially restrained response to the first waves of protests, civil disobedience and general strikes has grown more forceful over time, escalating into a brutal effort to put down the movement that has so far left thousands injured and more than 420 dead. Many of those killed have been young protesters, their lives ended with a single gunshot to the head.The coup returned the country to full military rule after a short span of quasi-democracy that began in 2011, when the military, which had been in power since 1962, implemented parliamentary elections and other reforms. In the weeks since the coup, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's ousted civilian leader, has faced charges in a secret court.What led to the military coup in Myanmar?Parliament was scheduled to hold its first session since the country's Nov. 8 elections, in which the National League for Democracy, Myanmar's leading civilian party, won 83 percent of the body's available seats.The military refused to accept the results of the vote, which was widely seen as a referendum on the popularity of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. As head of the National League for Democracy, she had been the de facto civilian leader since her election in 2015.The new Parliament was expected to endorse the election results and approve the next government.The possibility of the coup emerged after the military, which had tried in the country's Supreme Court to argue that the election results were fraudulent, threatened to "take action" and surrounded the houses of Parliament with soldiers.How was the coup carried out?The military detained the leaders of the National League for Democracy and other civilian officials, including Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint, cabinet ministers, the chief ministers of several regions, opposition politicians, writers and activists.The coup was effectively announced on the military-owned Myawaddy TV station when a news presenter cited the 2008 Constitution, which allows the military to declare a national emergency. The state of emergency, he said, will remain in place for one year. The military quickly seized control of the country's infrastructure, suspending most television broadcasts and canceling domestic and international flights.Telephone and internet access was suspended in major cities. The stock market and commercial banks were closed, and long lines were seen outside A.T.M.s in some places. In Yangon, the country's largest city and former capital, residents ran to markets to stock up on food and other supplies.How are people protesting and what has been the military's response?Weeks of relatively peaceful protests quickly turned deadly on Feb. 20 when two unarmed protesters were killed by security forces in Mandalay, one of whom was a 16-year-old boy.The deaths preceded a general strike on Feb. 22, when millions of people across the country took to the streets.Since then, an expanded civil disobedience movement has paralyzed the banking system and made it difficult for the military to get much done.As the demonstrations entered their second month, the military, notorious for having crushed democracy movements in 1988 and 2007 by shooting peaceful protesters, became more violent in its response.Week after week, the armed forces have escalated their attacks on the demonstrators. Including the toll from the bloodiest day of the crackdown to date, on March 27, the military has killed more than 420 people and assaulted, detained or tortured thousands of others, according to a monitoring group.What led protesters to take up arms?After weeks of peaceful protests, the front line of Myanmar's resistance is mobilizing into a kind of guerrilla force. In the cities, protesters have built barricades to protect neighborhoods from military incursions and learned how to make smoke bombs on the internet. In the forests, they are training in basic warfare techniques and plotting to sabotage military-linked facilities.The boldness and desperation of this new armed front recalls the radicalization of a previous generation of democracy activists in Myanmar, who traded treatises on political philosophy for guns. As in the past, the hard-line opposition is a defensive response to the military's mounting reign of terror.But there is a growing recognition that such efforts may not be enough — that the Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar military is known, needs to be countered on its own terms. In the country's jungles, protesters are training with firearms and hand grenades.In March, remnants of the ousted Parliament, who consider themselves the legitimate government, said that a "revolution" was needed to save the country. They have called for the formation of a federal army.Who is Aung San Suu Kyi?Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power as state councilor in 2016 after the country's first fully democratic vote in decades.Her ascension to leadership was seen as a critical moment in the transition of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to democracy from military dictatorship. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the country's independence hero Gen. Aung San, spent more than 15 years under house arrest.Her time in detention made her an international icon, and she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.After she was released from house arrest in 2010, her reputation was tarnished by her cooperation with the military and her vociferous defense of the country's deadly campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority group. In 2019, she represented Myanmar at a trial in the International Court of Justice, at which she defended it against accusations of ethnic cleansing.Many believed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's cooperation with the military was a pragmatic move that would hasten the evolution to full democracy, but her detention since the coup appeared to prove the lie in the military's commitment to democracy.Why is Aung San Suu Kyi on trial?A secret trial for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and Mr. Win Myint, the deposed president, began on Feb. 16. They face obscure charges that could land them in prison for six years and three years, respectively.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of violating import restrictions after walkie-talkies and other foreign equipment were found in her villa compound. She was also charged with contravening a natural disaster management law by interacting with a crowd during the coronavirus pandemic, a charge that had not been disclosed publicly before.Mr. Win Myint has been charged with breaching the natural disaster restrictions.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was denied legal representation, and her lawyer was not told that the trial had begun. It is believed that the trial could take up to a year, and it is widely seen as a pretext for keeping Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi in detention.Who is Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing?After the coup, the military handed power to the army chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.The move prolongs the general's power even though he is supposed to age out as army chief this summer. His patronage network, centered on lucrative family businesses, could well have been undermined by his retirement, especially had he not been able to secure a clean exit.Under the former power-sharing agreement, General Min Aung Hlaing presided over two business conglomerates and was able to appoint three key cabinet members who oversee the police and border guards.The military never fell under the civilian government's control. In recent years, the army, with General Min Aung Hlaing at the helm, has overseen campaigns against several of the country's ethnic minority groups, including the Rohingya, the Shan and the Kokang.What has been the international reaction?Several major world leaders quickly condemned the coup, demanding that Myanmar's military immediately free Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained government officials and honor the November election results. But it was not immediately clear what sort of concrete actions, if any, other nations might take.The Biden administration, which has sought to elevate human rights as a foreign policy priority, announced sanctions in late March in coordination with the European Union that named military officials and other entities in Myanmar for their violence against democracy advocates.António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, said the coup developments "represent a serious blow to democratic reforms in Myanmar." And Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said in a Twitter post that the "vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released." The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, Thomas Vajda, called the bloodshed across the country on March 27 "horrifying."As security forces fired at unarmed demonstrators and rounded up protesters, escalating their crackdown, the international community sharply criticized Myanmar's leadership."We strongly condemn the escalating violence against protests in Myanmar and call on the military to immediately halt the use of force against peaceful protesters," said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman with the United Nations human rights office.How has China, Myanmar's biggest neighbor, reacted?China, which shares a 1,300-mile border with Myanmar and is one of the country's largest investors, has responded cautiously, having cultivated cordial relations with both Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military hierarchy that detained her."China and Myanmar are friendly neighbors. We hope that all parties will properly handle their differences under the Constitution and legal framework to maintain political and social stability," Wang Wenbin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in Beijing on Feb. 22, the day of the general strike.Myanmar was the first stop of a regional good-will tour in January by China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, who pledged to furnish free Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines to Myanmar.Hannah Beech and Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.

Images From a 'Day of Shame' in Myanmar, With Scores Shot DeadPhotographs by The New York TimesMarch 27, 2021Children, including a 5-year-old-boy, were among those killed on Saturday as the country's security forces cracked down on nationwide protests against a coup. A New York Times photographer was there.In the deadliest day in Myanmar since the Feb. 1 military coup, dozens of people, and perhaps more than 100, were killed on Saturday by security forces cracking down on nationwide protests.Among those fatally shot on Saturday were a 5-year-old boy, two 13-year-old boys and a 14-year-old girl. A baby girl in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, was struck in the eye with a rubber bullet, although her parents said she was expected to survive."Today is a day of shame for the armed forces," Dr. Sasa, a spokesman for a group of elected officials who say they represent Myanmar's government, said in a statement. The killings also drew condemnation from countries around the word, including the United States, Britain and the European Union.On Saturday, the U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, Thomas L. Vajda, said security forces were "murdering unarmed civilians, including children," and he called the bloodshed "horrifying."Britain's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, called Saturday's killings "a new low" in a Twitter post.The widespread killings, which took place in more than two dozen cities across the country, came a day after military-run television threatened protesters with getting "shot in the back and the back of the head" if they persisted in opposing military rule. Many of Saturday's victims were bystanders.In Meiktila, a city in central Myanmar, 14-year-old Ma Pan Ei Phyu was at home when security forces began shooting randomly in the neighborhood, said her father, U Min Min Tun. The family did not hear a shot, and they didn't realize that she had been killed until she fell to the floor, having been hit in the chest.In Yangon, Maung Wai Yan Tun, 13, was playing outside when the police and soldiers arrived. Scared, he ran away and was shot, his mother told the online news outlet Mizzima.The killings took place on Armed Forces Day, a holiday honoring the Tatmadaw, as Myanmar's military is known.A protester running past a roadblock in Yangon, above.

The old job, the old office, the old week — for many New Yorkers, the possibility of the return of something resembling their old life appears finally within reach. For them, the year of the pandemic was a blip, a pause, however frustrating, in their lives.But for so many others, the old life is gone forever, washed away in tragedy, a job erased or a reordering of priorities.New York may be just months away from seeming like its former self — restaurants and bars buzzing with people, subways full of vaccinated riders. The next few weeks will bring many reasons to feel hopeful. An increase in vaccine supply means appointments should be easier to secure, and the warmer weather will begin to draw people out of their homes.But look closer and you see the truth. New York couldn't possibly emerge from this year the same. Not after all this. Every street, block and building has suffered loss in some form.The make-do adjustments, pivots and reactions of the last year have since calcified, becoming regular parts of the day. This is the new New York, and these are some of the new New York lives:Andrew S. Gonzalez, 31, was a chef and menu planner for a chain of restaurants in Qatar. Now, he's back home in the Lower East Side, where he hustles food deliveries for DoorDash and Postmates and is getting to know his 9-year-old son, Nael, whom he had only seen through biannual visits over the years. "I'm starting, like, all new," he said.Bienvenida D. Morales, 51, found a new job assembling and handing out meals through the city's public schools. It's like discovering a new city, one filled with need. "Families come, they say, 'Thank you, thank you, it's all I have to eat today,'" she said.In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Ofelia Becerra Díaz, 41, sees only loss. An apartment rearranged by absence. Her sister, Ana Ellsy Becerra, who lived in Coney Island, died of Covid-19 a month ago. Her cremated remains are kept in Ms. Díaz's apartment, an almost unbearable addition to the home. Two of her sister's sons moved in and share one of the bedrooms. It is a home steeped in grief, and it all happened so quickly."I work hard in a restaurant," she said. "I want to change my life. It's too hard, because I love my sister."If the city has long had millions of stories, many of them have been changed, rearranged. These are people who now seek to reclaim their places or find new ones.Joan H. Cappello, a Broadway usher and former Off Broadway stage manager, finds herself avoiding any new, Covid-era theater productions — "it makes me agitated" — and instead walks for miles, every day, in Central Park.In the Bronx, Mark Vuksanaj, 64, has spent the last year in lockdown taking care of his elderly parents. His father died a few weeks ago of natural causes, and his mother has secured an upcoming vaccination appointment, but he's sure he'll stay stuck in his new habits, staying indoors, "imprisoned."Gone, for many, is the idea that life will someday pick up where it left off a year ago."You've got to have a big heart in the city," said Elio Garcia, 39, a restaurateur who now works as a cook in one of his own kitchens. "You know what I'm saying?"His is an example of how a New Yorker's relationship to home, no matter the life span, has been altered. Mr. Garcia, 39, who owns the Essex World Cafe in the Financial District, finds his days have reverted to the beginning of his career. While the cafe remains closed, Mr. Garcia, normally a front-of-the-house man and expediter, works in the kitchen of a cafe in Sunset Park in Brooklyn."I cook, I clean dishes, I do everything," he added, jobs he once paid others to do.And there is the frustration of living in a great city still largely closed off. Seen from above, as in countless films and shows, its defining images appear untouched: towering spires and arrow-straight avenues, the broad shoulders of Manhattan's skyline standing sentry along the greens of Central Park.But New York doles out its rewards to those who interact with the place. To live here is to have claimed the little corners and haunts that make the whole thing work. Those who feel lucky to have lost precious little this past year — job intact, family healthy — still find themselves members of a quiet community that simply misses the old ways.Mohammadreza Azimi, 35, a data scientist in Hell's Kitchen, is eager to return to days spent working in coffee shops or the public library, to the comfort brought by the hushed company of strangers in the grand Rose Main Reading Room on Fifth Avenue.Jonathon Ortiz, 29, a maintenance worker in the Bronx, has eaten tons of fruits and vegetables this year at home, and longs to visit his favorite chain restaurants — pasta at Olive Garden, shrimp at Red Lobster, the 2-for-$22 specials at Applebee's, the fries at Dallas BBQ. "I can almost taste it," he said.Elizabeth Rosario, 33, asks for nothing more than a busy Starbucks — "I hope," she said, "people don't forget how to interact with people." And Soné Sanders, 29, a financial technology consultant, hopes for the return of the Afropunk festival in Brooklyn, but would settle for much less. "I want to go to a bar and there be more than one person," she said. "I miss the spontaneity. I know there are things going on, but I want there to be like 40 to 50 things that I can get FOMO over."Fear Of Missing Out: now something to look forward to.New Yorkers yearning to return to a favorite activity are also grappling with a hesitancy and wariness, for reasons physical or emotional, of taking that plunge. Ms. Sanders can't wait to hear live music, but only if the environment is safe from the virus — "I like my lungs more than I like to dance," she said. Ms. Cappello said she thinks she'll get emotional when theaters reopen. "It's such a sacred place for me that even if it were to be a reading or a workshop or anything, I'm sure I will cry."Mr. Azimi thinks about going to happy hour after work at places like Papillon Bistro or Redemption Sports Lounge. For now, he'll continue to mostly hang out alone, as many of his colleagues have left the city.Netai Schwartz, 23, longs for the simple days of unplanned meetings with friends at his favorite bar. "Going out now, everything is orchestrated and a big ordeal," he said in Central Park recently.A glimpse at the new New York could be seen on a recent Sunday in one of its movie theaters — cool and solitary respites in the bustling city, allowed to reopen with limited capacity in early March. Jon Morgenstern, 68, and Darla Hastings, 55, ventured to a favorite theater, the Angelika on Houston Street, where they used to go all the time.They bought tickets to "The Father," and entered the familiar-but-different setting, with temperature checks from the usher and masks in seats that were distant from the 14 other people in the theater."As we sat down, we said, 'It's so normal,'" Ms. Hastings said later.Then the room darkened, and an unfamiliar message appeared on the screen. It was celebratory, or it was depressing, depending on where one fell on the pleasure of the familiar versus the annoyance of change, the old city and the new.It said, "Welcome back."Sofía Cerda Campero, Nate Schweber and Matthew Sedacca contributed reporting.

Now, he's back home in the Lower East Side, where he hustles food deliveries for DoorDash and Postmates and is getting to know his 9-year-old son, Nael, whom he had only seen through biannual visits over the years. "I'm starting, like, all new," he said.Bienvenida D. Morales, 51, found a new job assembling and handing out meals through the city's public schools. It's like discovering a new city, one filled with need. "Families come, they say, 'Thank you, thank you, it's all I have to eat today,'" she said.In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Ofelia Becerra Díaz, 41, sees only loss. An apartment rearranged by absence. Her sister, Ana Ellsy Becerra, who lived in Coney Island, died of Covid-19 a month ago. Her cremated remains are kept in Ms. Díaz's apartment, an almost unbearable addition to the home. Two of her sister's sons moved in and share one of the bedrooms. It is a home steeped in grief, and it all happened so quickly."I work hard in a restaurant," she said. "I want to change my life. It's too hard, because I love my sister."If the city has long had millions of stories, many of them have been changed, rearranged. These are people who now seek to reclaim their places or find new ones.Joan H. Cappello, a Broadway usher and former Off Broadway stage manager, finds herself avoiding any new, Covid-era theater productions — "it makes me agitated" — and instead walks for miles, every day, in Central Park.In the Bronx, Mark Vuksanaj, 64, has spent the last year in lockdown taking care of his elderly parents. His father died a few weeks ago of natural causes, and his mother has secured an upcoming vaccination appointment, but he's sure he'll stay stuck in his new habits, staying indoors, "imprisoned."Gone, for many, is the idea that life will someday pick up where it left off a year ago."You've got to have a big heart in the city," said Elio Garcia, 39, a restaurateur who now works as a cook in one of his own kitchens. "You know what I'm saying?"His is an example of how a New Yorker's relationship to home, no matter the life span, has been altered. Mr. Garcia, 39, who owns the Essex World Cafe in the Financial District, finds his days have reverted to the beginning of his career. While the cafe remains closed, Mr. Garcia, normally a front-of-the-house man and expediter, works in the kitchen of a cafe in Sunset Park in Brooklyn."I cook, I clean dishes, I do everything," he added, jobs he once paid others to do.And there is the frustration of living in a great city still largely closed off. Seen from above, as in countless films and shows, its defining images appear untouched: towering spires and arrow-straight avenues, the broad shoulders of Manhattan's skyline standing sentry along the greens of Central Park.But New York doles out its rewards to those who interact with the place. To live here is to have claimed the little corners and haunts that make the whole thing work. Those who feel lucky to have lost precious little this past year — job intact, family healthy — still find themselves members of a quiet community that simply misses the old ways.Mohammadreza Azimi, 35, a data scientist in Hell's Kitchen, is eager to return to days spent working in coffee shops or the public library, to the comfort brought by the hushed company of strangers in the grand Rose Main Reading Room on Fifth Avenue.Jonathon Ortiz, 29, a maintenance worker in the Bronx, has eaten tons of fruits and vegetables this year at home, and longs to visit his favorite chain restaurants — pasta at Olive Garden, shrimp at Red Lobster, the 2-for-$22 specials at Applebee's, the fries at Dallas BBQ. "I can almost taste it," he said.Elizabeth Rosario, 33, asks for nothing more than a busy Starbucks — "I hope," she said, "people don't forget how to interact with people." And Soné Sanders, 29, a financial technology consultant, hopes for the return of the Afropunk festival in Brooklyn, but would settle for much less. "I want to go to a bar and there be more than one person," she said. "I miss the spontaneity. I know there are things going on, but I want there to be like 40 to 50 things that I can get FOMO over."Fear Of Missing Out: now something to look forward to.New Yorkers yearning to return to a favorite activity are also grappling with a hesitancy and wariness, for reasons physical or emotional, of taking that plunge. Ms. Sanders can't wait to hear live music, but only if the environment is safe from the virus — "I like my lungs more than I like to dance," she said. Ms. Cappello said she thinks she'll get emotional when theaters reopen. "It's such a sacred place for me that even if it were to be a reading or a workshop or anything, I'm sure I will cry."Mr. Azimi thinks about going to happy hour after work at places like Papillon Bistro or Redemption Sports Lounge. For now, he'll continue to mostly hang out alone, as many of his colleagues have left the city.Netai Schwartz, 23, longs for the simple days of unplanned meetings with friends at his favorite bar. "Going out now, everything is orchestrated and a big ordeal," he said in Central Park recently.A glimpse at the new New York could be seen on a recent Sunday in one of its movie theaters — cool and solitary respites in the bustling city, allowed to reopen with limited capacity in early March. Jon Morgenstern, 68, and Darla Hastings, 55, ventured to a favorite theater, the Angelika on Houston Street, where they used to go all the time.They bought tickets to "The Father," and entered the familiar-but-different setting, with temperature checks from the usher and masks in seats that were distant from the 14 other people in the theater."As we sat down, we said, 'It's so normal,'" Ms. Hastings said later.Then the room darkened, and an unfamiliar message appeared on the screen. It was celebratory, or it was depressing, depending on where one fell on the pleasure of the familiar versus the annoyance of change, the old city and the new.It said, "Welcome back."Sofía Cerda Campero, Nate Schweber and Matthew Sedacca contributed reporting.

MOSCOW — Russia has lauded with much fanfare the arrival of its homegrown vaccine, Sputnik V, in Latin America and Africa, and even in some countries in Europe, calling it a solution to shortages around the world.It has been less vocal, though, about one country that is also importing the vaccine: Russia.The Russian government has contracted out the manufacture of Sputnik V to a South Korean company that has already sent the vaccine to Russia, and plans to do the same with a company from India.While the scale of the imports are impossible to gauge because of nondisclosure agreements, they undermine some of the narrative Russia has proudly presented about its role in the pandemic as an exporter of vaccines to needy countries.The imports, which are expected to ramp up in coming weeks and months, could help Russia overcome a dismally slow vaccination rollout at home. They also illustrate that even countries whose scientists designed successful shots rely on cross border trade for vaccine supplies.Russian officials said last fall that overseas manufacturing could partly meet demand at home, but have since gone quiet about importing a product that has been held up as a triumph of the country's scientists. Manufacturing the vaccine in Russia, however, has been a different story.Russia received two cargo planes loaded with Sputnik V from the South Korean manufacturer, GL Rapha, in December and the company expects to send another shipment in coming days. Indian vaccine makers are also expected to export the Russian-designed vaccine to Russia, according to Indian diplomats. "We face the prospect of increasing this cooperation in the field of vaccines," India's ambassador to Russia, Shri Varma, said at a news conference in January. "We envisage a major rolling out of Sputnik vaccine in India, using the Indian production capacities for India, for Russia and for the entire world."Russia has four production deals in India. One Indian company, Virchow Biotech in Hyderabad, India, last week signed a manufacturing deal with Russia's sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, to make 200 million doses a year of Sputnik V.Russian vaccine production got off to a slow start as producers struggled for months last fall to obtain biotechnology equipment that is made in China, and was in short supply.This past week, President Vladimir V. Putin said that enough Sputnik V to fully inoculate 8.9 million people had been distributed in Russia since regulators approved the drug last August. Russia's minister of industry said Monday he expected a quick ramp-up by April to twice that amount every month.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedMarch 28, 2021, 3:40 p.m. ETSix states are opening vaccination to all adults on Monday, with many residents eager for shots.Cases in Florida, a national Covid bellwether, are rising — especially among younger people.For some, New York City will never be the same.Russia's vaccination campaign has fallen far behind that of most European nations and the United States. Russia has vaccinated 4.4 percent of its population, compared to 10 percent in the European Union and 26 percent in the United States.The Kremlin this past week for the first time acknowledged that scarcity of the vaccine played a role in Mr. Putin's decision to delay his own inoculation to avoid stimulating demand for shots before they became widely available outside the capital.In January, when Mr. Putin became eligible for a shot under Russian rules based on his age, "production was not yet sufficient to fully meet demand in the regions," said his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov.It's not clear how large a role the imports will play in alleviating scarcity, accelerating vaccinations and saving lives in Russia. But it positions Russia lower in the pecking order of vaccine geopolitics, as an importer rather than just an exporter.Russian officials have chosen to highlight exports, however. "A vaccine for all humankind," the Sputnik V website declares. State media has lavished attention on even relatively small shipments of tens or hundreds of thousands of doses to foreign countries.More than 20 countries have begun vaccinating with small amounts of shots provided by Russia, including Argentina, Hungary, Bolivia, Algeria, Paraguay and others. Russian officials have said that most demand for Sputnik V in foreign countries will be met by overseas production.But vaccine nationalism by countries with production capacity appears to be on the rise. Contracts for delivery or rights to a vaccine design proved less important than controlling the means of production in two shifts in the vaccine trade this week.India, a major vaccine maker, last week held back from export nearly all of the 2.4 million doses manufactured by a private company, the Serum Institute of India, as the number of infections from the coronavirus shot up across the country. The European Union also moved on emergency legislation to curb vaccine exports, a change that could limit British imports of the AstraZeneca vaccine designed at Oxford University from producers in the bloc.President Emmanuel Macron of France said it was the "the end of naïveté" for the European Union, which has significant production capacity but had been exporting doses despite rapidly rising cases within the bloc.The United States and Britain have both imported domestically designed vaccines made in foreign countries. The United States has done so while prohibiting some exports of U.S.-made doses abroad.Russia imported the South Korean-produced Sputnik V in December as it expanded the categories of people eligible for vaccination. The doses arrived in two Asiana Airlines cargo planes, according to an announcement by the airline, which was touting its cold shipment service.In written answers to questions, GL Rapha, the Korean manufacturer, said it could not discuss shipments because of the nondisclosure agreement.The company said it expects to produce 150 million doses of Sputnik V this year. The Russian Direct Investment Fund did not respond to questions about imports to Russia.Oleg Matsnev contributed research.

For 12 straight days and counting, Transportation Security Administration officers have screened more than 1 million people a day at domestic airports. On Skyscanner, a travel-booking site, weekly booking volume has increased by 75 percent in the last month. In a recent survey of nearly 2,800 clients, Travel Leaders Network, a North American consortium of travel advisers, found that those who are vaccinated are 20 percent more likely than their unvaccinated peers to have a vacation booked.As national vaccination rates trend upward, more people are traveling or planning to travel. If you hope to do the same this spring, here's the latest information and guidance.What is the official stance of the C.D.C. on travel?Earlier this month, in a new set of guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention left its stance on travel unchanged: Don't do it unless you must, even if you are fully vaccinated.On Monday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C.'s director, warned Americans that traveling could increase the risk of spreading the virus, particularly new variants, and urged against travel."We're worried not just for what happens when you are on the airplane itself, but what happens when people travel," she said. "We just don't want to be at this rapid uptick of cases again."Why would fully vaccinated people not be encouraged to travel?The issue isn't so much vaccinated people themselves, who are largely protected against serious disease and death. It's everyone else: the unvaccinated travelers in the airport security line, by the hotel pool and across the aisle on the train. That's because one major scientific question is still unsettled: Can a vaccinated person transmit the virus to an unvaccinated one? As my Times colleague Apoorva Mandavilli recently wrote, "While all of the Covid-19 vaccines are spectacularly good at shielding people from severe illness and death, the research is unclear on exactly how well they stop the virus from taking root in an immunized person's nose and then spreading to others."Although "most vaccines don't completely prevent infection," said Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, "many do prevent infection from spreading in the body and causing disease, which often also prevents transmission because viral loads are low."As for why the C.D.C. seems to be proceeding cautiously: "The issue right now is that we don't have much data on how well Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission," Dr. Watson said. "The data we do have so far is encouraging, but there is still uncertainty. It also may differ, depending on the vaccine and presence of variants of concern in circulation."With some states eliminating some restrictions, are masks still required on airplanes and in airports?Yes. In January President Biden mandated masks nationwide for airports and interstate travel, including planes, trains and buses. Which means you'll still have to wear a mask at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, even though masks are no longer required in Texas.Travel executives, meanwhile, have hinted that masks and other mitigation measures may be around for a while."We refresh the air in the cabin every two to three minutes," said Gary Kelly, the chief executive of Southwest Airlines, in a Washington Post forum earlier this month. "We have very intense deep cleaning protocols. And those things won't go away just because the pandemic is declared ended. So, I think it just remains to be seen what role masks play in an enclosed environment like that."If I do travel, what are some ways I can protect myself and others?A year in, the basics are old hat: Wear a snug mask, avoid crowds (for instance, don't congregate by the gate while boarding) and wash your hands. The C.D.C. also recommends waiting two weeks after your second vaccine dose before traveling — long enough for protection to kick in — and getting a coronavirus test within three days of departure and upon return."Because we have an open scientific question of whether you can transmit even if you've been vaccinated, I think that's a reasonable thing to do," Dr. Watson said. "Let's take those extra steps to protect each other — and then we can get this under control more quickly."How do I decide where to go?Some spring and summer stalwarts are non-starters; most of Europe, for example, for now remains off-limits to most Americans. Health experts also recommend common-sense precautions, like avoiding international travel to countries with high infection rates and inadequate medical infrastructure."You want to make sure you don't bring the virus back with you, and you also don't want to burden another health care system if, in the very low chance, you do become sick and become symptomatic," Dr. Watson said.When traveling domestically, research infection and vaccination rates in the destination. And pick places and trips that naturally encourage being outside and remaining socially distanced from strangers."We should try to try to hold the line and do the things we know are safe, because we still have so much virus out there," Dr. Watson said. "Regardless of vaccination status, I would not go into a crowded club right now."Do I need to show proof of vaccination in order to travel?Broadly speaking: not yet. But probably eventually, depending on where you're going.Although proof of vaccination is not yet required to board a plane or book a hotel, it's starting to open certain doors.As of March 26, Americans who are fully vaccinated (or those who can prove previous infection) can travel to Iceland, and vaccinated (or previously infected) European Union and European Economic Area citizens are allowed to avoid Iceland's existing border measures like testing and quarantine. Vaccinated foreigners can also sidestep testing and quarantining in Belize. Other countries are almost certain to follow suit in the coming months.As a means to reboot the decimated tourism industry, the European Union is considering a proposal to adopt a digital pass that would allow fully vaccinated E.U. residents and their families (or those who can produce a negative test or recovery from the virus) to travel freely within the bloc.In the meantime, the airline industry is testing various vaccine passports, which digitally store vaccination records, test results and other health information. Passengers on British Airways flights from London to India can now input their health information while booking, just as they would a passport number. Third-party health apps, including CommonPass and the IATA Travel Pass, are being tested on different airlines and routes, and are expected to be rolled out to the public in the coming months. Earlier this month, Air France launched a trial program of an app called the ICC AOKpass on round-trip flights between Paris and Los Angeles and Paris and San Francisco.In an interview last week on NBC Nightly News, Ed Bastian, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, said it's likely that vaccine passports will eventually be required for international flights.Proof of vaccination may also be required to board a cruise ship: Royal Caribbean is requiring passengers 16 and older to be vaccinated for the May maiden voyage of Odyssey of the Seas, which will depart from Israel — which is outpacing much of the world in vaccinations — and sail the Mediterrean. Virgin Voyages, Crystal Cruises and other cruise lines have also announced vaccine requirements for all passengers and crew.The idea of proof of vaccination as a requirement for travel is not new; certain countries require travelers to be vaccinated against yellow fever. The World Health Organization, for its part, has come out against the idea of Covid-19 vaccine certificates to greenlight travel."Quite simply, vaccination is just not available enough around the world and is not available certainly on an equitable basis," said Michael Ryan, the executive director of the W.H.O. Health Emergencies Programme, during a news conference earlier this month.What should I expect at my hotel or Airbnb?In short: fewer people, lots of cleaning and, most likely, scaled-back amenities.The hotel industry got clobbered last year; the latest forecast from the American Hotel & Lodging Association projects that half of domestic hotel rooms will remain empty this year, with sector employment hovering around 500,000 jobs lower than prepandemic levels.The report also found that 62 percent of consumers consider cleanliness among the top factors when choosing a hotel. Last year, all the major chains and most of the independents introduced sweeping new health-and-safety guidelines, which are still in place today even as business ticks up: enhanced cleaning and disinfection, social distancing, mask mandates and, depending on state and local restrictions, occupancy limits and pared-back services like dining, spas and babysitting. Many hotel companies, including Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and IHG, also offer contactless digital check-in and checkout; some have also introduced physical door "seals" — an indication that no one has entered a room since it was last cleaned.Vacation rental companies have also revised their standards. Airbnb guests and hosts are required to wear masks when interacting in person, and hosts are required to complete a five-step cleaning process — which includes detailed guidelines for how approved disinfectants must be used — between stays.52 Places to Love in 2021We asked readers to tell us about the spots that have delighted, inspired and comforted them in a dark year. Here, 52 of the more than 2,000 suggestions we received, to remind us that the world still awaits.If I'm traveling between states, will I still have to quarantine or take a test?It depends. In the last month or two, several states — including Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Ohio and New York — have loosened testing and quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated visitors and returning residents. Expect cross-state guidelines to continue to evolve as more becomes known about vaccine efficacy.The good news: "The data that we have so far is encouraging — we're seeing in some of the trials that there does appear to be a large reduction in transmission and, in some cases, even infection," Dr. Watson said.Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Airbnb guests and hosts are required to wear masks when interacting in person, and hosts are required to complete a five-step cleaning process — which includes detailed guidelines for how approved disinfectants must be used — between stays.52 Places to Love in 2021We asked readers to tell us about the spots that have delighted, inspired and comforted them in a dark year.

MINNEAPOLIS — The sacred intersection where George Floyd died beneath the knee of a police officer has seen such an increase in violence that food delivery drivers are afraid to venture there. There have been gun battles, with bloodied shooting victims dragged to ambulances because of barricades keeping the police and emergency vehicles away."Having no police: This is the experiment right here," said P.J. Hill, a leader of Worldwide Outreach for Christ, a church that has been on that corner in Minneapolis for almost 40 years. "This is their one-block experiment."Residents all over town still complain of officers using excessive force, like during a recent confrontation in which a white officer appeared to wind up and punch a Black teenager. And officers accuse some community members of antagonizing them, like in a recent dispute over a homeless encampment that erupted into a melee with punches and pepper spray.Ten months ago, Minneapolis, and the country, seemed to coalesce around the belief that policing needed an overhaul after gruesome video footage surfaced of the last moments of Mr. Floyd's life. Now, with the murder trial of the officer who knelt on Mr. Floyd's neck scheduled to begin on Monday, the struggle over what to overhaul and how to do it has left Minneapolis at war with itself over public safety and the role of the police.A pledge by most City Council members in June to defund and dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety met fierce resistance. It has since given way to a grab bag of efforts which have yet to prove their effectiveness and have left the city fractured.Looming over everything is a palpable unease over what the 12 jurors will decide in the trial of Derek Chauvin, who is facing second- and third-degree murder charges, as well as manslaughter, after being captured on video kneeling on Mr. Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes in May.Many worry that an acquittal could set back the work that has been done to reform public safety and to attempt healing, and put the city right back where it was last summer with buildings ablaze and the streets roiling with anger."People don't have much faith that he's going to be convicted," said Pastor Brian Herron of Zion Baptist Church in the neighborhood Near North, the historic heart of Black Minneapolis. "I think there's hope that he is, but we have seen this movie before. We've watched this movie over and over and over again. We can recite the lines."Cities all across America last year faced a surge in violence, fueled in part by the economic despair and alienation brought on by the pandemic, criminologists said. Minneapolis was no exception: It saw a 25 percent increase in homicides, rapes, robberies and assaults.But home in on the four neighborhoods surrounding George Floyd Square, the name given to the corner where Mr. Floyd died, and the story is far bleaker and deadlier. In those areas — Powderhorn Park, Central, Bryant and Bancroft — violent crime shot up by 66 percent last year, according to statistics from the Police Department. And this year, so far, little has changed.The area has become something of an autonomous zone, with barriers and signs calling it "the free state of George Floyd." The police have stayed away for almost a year to avoid inflaming tensions.Residents and city leaders have tussled over the role that the Police Department's depleted ranks have played in the violence plaguing the entire city. Around 200 officers have left the force, some temporarily, over the past year, with many taking leave for post-traumatic stress disorder. The City Charter allows for 888 officers, but there are currently 648 on active duty, city officials said.Supporters of defunding the police have applauded steps to redirect $8 million from the Police Department's budget, which now sits at about $170 million. Some of those funds have gone to the Office of Violence Prevention, which has seen its budget grow more than fourfold over the past year to about $7 million.With that money, the office is expanding programs that offer social services, said Sasha Cotton, its director. The office is also developing a program modeled after Cure Violence, a national violence-intervention initiative. The city's version will consist of six teams of about 15 people, some former gang members, working in communities to settle any simmering disputes that may lead to violence.The growth in resources won't make the work any simpler, Ms. Cotton said. That's because the challenges have grown, too: the surge in violence, the pandemic-induced economic hardship, the unease over the trial."We're under a microscope and at an epicenter that no city wants to be in," she said. "I think that from these challenges there is real growth happening, and that we will come out of it better on the other side. But it's sort of like that awkward teenage space that people have to go through."Pastor Curtis Farrar, who leads Worldwide Outreach for Christ at George Floyd Square, said gang violence had long been a problem in the area, but it had been improving before Mr. Floyd was killed and the police pulled back. Now the sounds of gunshots are a constant, and recently workers he has hired to change his church's windows have refused to come to the area because they feel it is too dangerous.In many ways, the future of the intersection could turn on the outcome of the trial. For too long, he said, the community has watched police officers kill and get away with it."I don't know if anybody at this point knows how it's going to be solved unless they see justice as really being blind," he said. "If they don't, we're going to have some serious problems in this community."Many officers worry about further unrest, said Sgt. Sherral Schmidt, the president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis. Officers began leaving the department in droves after the uprising last summer, she said, and morale has only gotten worse. With staffing shortage, officers have found themselves bouncing from call to call, with little opportunity to engage with the community, she said. Even the members of the community engagement team have been reassigned to different jobs to help make up for the patrol shortage, she said.Officers are expected to have to work 12-hour shifts once the trial reaches closing arguments, Sergeant Schmidt added."The biggest thing for our cops right now is they feel no support," she said. "So every day, they come in and it's like, 'Oh, what are we going to be scrutinized for today?'"Understand the George Floyd CaseHow George Floyd DiedOn May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, after a convenience store clerk claimed he used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.Mr. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, one of the police officers, handcuffed him and pinned him to the ground with a knee, an episode that was captured on video.What Happened to Derek ChauvinMr. Chauvinwas fired from the Minneapolis police force, along with three other officers. He has been charged with both second- and third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He now faces trial. Opening statements are scheduled for March 29.Here is what we knowup to this point in the case, and how the trial is expected to unfold.How Floyd's Death Ignited a MovementMr. Floyd's death set off a seriesof nationwide protests against police brutality from late May through June. The Black Lives Matter protests peaked on June 6, when half a million people turned out in nearly 550 places across the United States, making it possibly the largest movement in U.S. history. Some longtime civil rights activists have been critical of the police, but they have also criticized the way that supporters of the defund movement have tried to effect change. Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer, said that while she supports some resources going to social services, the defund movement is nothing more than "catchy slogans and catchphrases." She said that last summer she warned Jeremiah Ellison, a City Council member supporting efforts to dismantle the Police Department, that it would lead to only chaos."You're going to turn Minneapolis into the wild, Wild West," she recalled telling him.But Mr. Ellison said the uptick in violence in the city began long before any money was redirected from the police, and he credited council members for investing in alternatives to policing."To do what we've done in 10 months," he said, "as far as city government is concerned, that's kind of moving at light speed."In June, nine council members, a veto-proof majority, stood on a stage in a park behind large block letters that read, "Defund Police," and pledged to dismantle the Police Department."They stood on a stage in Powderhorn Park in front of the entire nation with a big sign, with one-million-point font saying, 'defund the police,'" said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, calling it an ill-conceived move. He could not support that position, he added, because he did not agree with it and "it wasn't going to be delivered."Many of those members have since backtracked. They proposed a measure last year to change the City Charter to create a Public Safety Department — of which the police would be just one part — that they say would promote a more holistic approach to public safety. That effort has failed, but a new proposal is on track to appear on the ballot this fall. Activists are also gathering signatures to get a measure on the ballot that would perform a similar action.Though he has disagreed with most council members about cutting the number of police officers, Mr. Frey has acknowledged the urgency to invest in other solutions."There's clearly a lot of passion and pain and frustration," he said.He has favored working with the police chief, Medaria Arradondo, to establish policy reforms — many of which his critics have said are too incremental.A number of new policies on the use of force has been put into effect, including requiring officers to intervene when a fellow officer is using impermissible force and requiring greater scrutiny when force is used against someone in handcuffs.For many residents, though, the policy changes have done nothing to upend what they see as an underlying culture of aggression and disrespect. D.A. Bullock, an activist and a filmmaker who lives in North Minneapolis, recalled recently going to a scene where the police had just shot someone and having officers aggressively tell him to get back."I've seen a number of interactions between police and residents since George Floyd was murdered, and I can't, from a practical standpoint, I can't identify anything that they're doing differently," Mr. Bullock said. "They still roll up, and they roll up in force. They're still very much aggressive. I haven't seen any de-escalation tactics."Still, if the city feels tense over the continued debate about policing and public safety, there are small signs of racial healing.One of them is on display every Sunday at Pastor Herron's church, which is predominantly Black. More white faces have been appearing in the pews, he said. It gives Pastor Herron hope that even as the city feels these days as if it is under siege — with National Guard troops on the streets, and concrete-and-wire barricades fortifying government buildings downtown — some people, at least, are trying to come together."If you look physically, it doesn't look like much has changed," he said. "But if you look with spiritual eyes, you see a conversation. You see a movement toward each other, instead of away from each other."He continued, "It's being done organically. We're not on purpose trying to be a multicultural church. It's what's in the atmosphere now."

WASHINGTON — Democrats have spent the last several years clamoring to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, seeing that as a necessary antidote to widening economic inequality and a rebuke of President Donald J. Trump's signature tax cuts.Now, under President Biden, they have a shot at ushering in the largest federal tax increase since 1942. It could help pay for a host of spending programs that liberal economists predict would bolster the economy's performance and repair a tax code that Democrats say encourages wealthy people to hoard assets and big companies to ship jobs and book profits overseas.The question is whether congressional Democrats and the White House can agree on how sharply taxes should rise and who, exactly, should pay the bill. They widely share the goal of reversing many of Mr. Trump's tax cuts from 2017, and of making the wealthy and big businesses pay more. But they do not yet agree on the details — and because Republicans are unlikely to support their efforts, they have no room for error in a closely divided Senate.For Mr. Biden, the need to find consensus is urgent. The president is set to travel to Pittsburgh on Wednesday to unveil the next phase of his economic agenda — a sprawling collection of programs that would invest in infrastructure, education, carbon-reduction and working mothers and cost $3 trillion to $4 trillion.The package, which follows on the heels of Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion economic aid bill, is central to the president's long-term plan to revitalize American workers and industry by funding bridges and roads, universal pre-K, emerging industries like advanced batteries and efforts to invigorate the fight against climate change.Mr. Biden plans to finance that spending, at least in part, with tax increases that could raise upward of $2.5 trillion in revenue if his plan hews closely to what he proposed in the 2020 presidential campaign. Aides suggest his proposals might not be entirely paid for, with some one-time spending increases offset by increased federal borrowing. "I think what you're going to see is the administration is going to put a pay-for on the table for at least some and maybe all of the infrastructure plan," said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. "If Team Biden makes a proposal, I'm sure we'll make adjustments but that's a good way to start."Others in his party, including his own transportation secretary, have pushed Mr. Biden to explore tax plans he did not campaign on, like taxing consumption, wealth or vehicle miles traveled. (A Transportation Department spokesman said on Saturday that there would be no vehicle-miles-traveled tax in the infrastructure proposal.) Mr. Biden has stressed his broad-brush desire to increase the tax burden on wealthy Americans who largely earn their money through inheritance or investment, to fund spending programs meant to help people who earn their money primarily through wages."I want to change the paradigm," Mr. Biden said Thursday during a news conference. "We start to reward work, not just wealth."Democratic lawmakers have promised for decades to raise taxes on companies and the wealthy, a desire that kicked into overdrive after Mr. Trump signed a tax-cut package that delivered an outsize share of its benefits to corporations and high earners. But they have struggled to muster the votes for large tax increases since President Bill Clinton signed a 1993 law that included a variety of hikes intended to help reduce the budget deficit. Business groups, conservative activists, lobbyists and donors across the ideological spectrum have largely blocked such attempts.President Barack Obama campaigned on ending tax cuts for the rich signed into law by President George W. Bush, but after the 2008 financial crisis, he cut deals with Republicans to extend those cuts, before allowing some of them to expire at the end of 2012.Liberal economists say this year could be different, thanks to the unique political and economic circumstances surrounding the recovery from the pandemic recession. With Mr. Biden's signing of a $1.9 trillion economic relief bill, financed entirely by federal borrowing, forecasters now expect the economy to grow this year at its fastest annual clip since the 1980s. Republicans and some economists have begun to warn of overheating growth spurring runaway inflation, which could reduce the salience of warnings that tax increases would cause growth to stall.Public polling shows broad support, even among many Republican voters, for raising taxes on large corporations and high-income individuals. The most conservative Democrats in the Senate, who hold great sway over Mr. Biden's legislative agenda, say they favor trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending so long as there is a plan to pay for it.That includes Senator Joe Manchin III, of West Virginia, who told reporters this week that Mr. Biden's infrastructure plan was "going to be enormous" and that its costs needed to be covered. He signaled openness to making changes to the 2017 tax overhaul, adding that the benefits in that legislation were "weighted in one direction to the upper end.""Where do they think it's going to come from? How are they going to fix America?" he said, when asked about Republican resistance to tax increases. "I don't think that's reasonable."Democrats widely share a desire to raise the corporate income tax rate after it was cut to 21 percent in 2017. And they want to raise the top marginal rate for individuals back to 39.6 percent from 37 percent.But there are disputes in the rank and file, with some favoring Mr. Biden's plan to set the corporate rate at 28 percent and others preferring a lower one, like 25 percent. There are also questions over which high-earning individuals should see a tax increase.Mr. Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. Some of his progressive allies, including Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have advocated raising taxes on a broader group. Democrats like Mr. Manchin have pushed him to consider additional tax plans that do not solely target the rich, like a European-style tax on consumption, though that type of tax could fall more heavily on low-income Americans than wealthy ones.Republicans are unlikely to support any plan to raise taxes, leaving administration officials and leading congressional Democrats to hammer out a plan on their own. But absent Republican support in the Senate, where both parties hold 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, Democrats would need to secure total consensus in their caucus to pass the legislation and use a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to bypass the 60-vote threshold for ending a filibuster.Business groups and Republican lawmakers, who supported the 2017 tax cuts, predict that any tax increase will slow economic growth and undermine the competitiveness of American companies. They contend that the economic and wage growth in the run-up to the pandemic prove that Mr. Trump's tax cuts worked, an argument Mr. Biden's advisers reject, citing research from the International Monetary Fund and others."He wants a massive tax increase and he wants to allocate the tax responsibility in this country, on the basis of class," said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. "That's a hell of a way to make tax policy. Sound tax policy is made on the basis of economics."Republicans who favor some form of an infrastructure bill have struggled to offer alternative ways to fund such an undertaking, which they argue should be significantly smaller than what Mr. Biden has floated. Some, however, are noodling on tax changes should a bipartisan plan emerge. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said this week that her committee would examine changes to the gas tax, or a related tax that also charges a fee to users of electric vehicles, as discussions continue about a funding mechanism.Many liberal economists say there are good reasons to raise taxes, starting with using those funds to invest in workers and help build economic opportunity. Spending on physical infrastructure, like roads and water pipes, or on programs like education and child care that are meant to help people earn more money could help curb persistent inequalities in income and wealth. The economists also say that tax increases that are properly set up would provide incentives for multinational companies to keep jobs in the United States and not shift profits to lower-tax foreign countries."The purpose of the tax system is to both raise enough revenue for what the government wants to do, and to make sure that as we're doing that we are encouraging activities that are in the national interest and discouraging ones that are not," said Heather Boushey, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.Key Democrats are trying to bring the party to consensus. The top tax writer in the Senate, Ron Wyden of Oregon, is drafting a series of bills to raise taxes, many of them overlapping with Mr. Biden's campaign proposals."I'll be ready to raise what the Democratic caucus decides is required to move forward," Mr. Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview.Mr. Wyden's plans include big changes to the portions of Mr. Trump's tax cuts that overhauled how the United States taxes multinational companies, including the creation of a minimum tax of sorts on income earned abroad. Mr. Wyden and many Democratic economists, including some inside the Biden administration, say that the tax was devised in a way that it ultimately incentivized companies to continue moving profits and activities offshore to avoid American taxes. Republican economists and some tax experts disagree and say the law has allowed U.S. companies to better compete globally.A report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation this month showed that multinational companies paid an average U.S. tax rate of less than 8 percent on their income in 2018, down from 16 percent in 2017. The report also found that those companies did not slow their practice of booking profits in low-tax havens like Bermuda.Mr. Biden, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Sanders have all drafted plans to raise revenues by amending the 2017 law to force multinational companies to pay more to the United States. One of the most lucrative ways to do that, according to tax scorekeepers, would be to increase the rate of the global minimum tax, forcing those companies to pay higher U.S. tax rates no matter where they locate jobs or profits.

WASHINGTON — As President Biden stood in the Rose Garden this month, basking in the glow of his newly enacted $1.9 trillion stimulus package, he singled out two lawmakers who had been toiling away in relative obscurity on its key provisions for years."Rosa, you and I've spent so much time on this," Mr. Biden said, addressing Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and a 30-year veteran of the House. "You guys — you, Patty and others — are the ones that have been leading this for so long, and it's finally coming to fruition."Patty, as in Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat beginning her 29th year in Congress, and Ms. DeLauro have spent decades working on initiatives to lift children out of poverty, often behind the scenes and out of the spotlight.But as Mr. Biden, 78 and himself a 36-year veteran of Capitol Hill, presses forward with an ambitious liberal agenda — including the sprawling pandemic aid law that is projected to cut child poverty by as much as half — Ms. DeLauro and Ms. Murray have deployed their legislative muscle and deep experience to deliver on his bold promises.The two teamed up to ensure that passage of the stimulus law included a lifeline to the nation's poorest families, expanding an existing tax credit to provide additional payments for a year to an estimated 27 million vulnerable children. Their success at doing so underscores a generational divide that is driving Congress in the Biden era: As the Democratic Party is energized and pulled to the left by a dynamic and diverse set of newcomers, it is the liberal veterans — many of them women — who have built up expertise and influence and are positioned to push through landmark initiatives.Ms. DeLauro, 78, the colorful daughter of Italian immigrants who settled in New Haven, Conn., and Ms. Murray, 70, the quiet, self-described "mom in tennis shoes" who worked in her father's five-and-dime store outside Seattle, had labored for decades, sometimes fruitlessly, on child poverty, education and health care issues. So when Mr. Biden came into office promising a sweeping federal rescue initiative, they already had proposals on their shelves and a keen sense of what it would take to get them done.They worked the phones with White House officials and haggled with their colleagues to help usher through what is regarded as the most aggressive federal intervention to help impoverished children since the New Deal."They are the worker bees of the Congress — when it comes to social and domestic policy, these two ladies just rule," said Leticia Mederos, who worked for both women and was most recently Ms. DeLauro's chief of staff, during two decades on Capitol Hill. "So much of the Democratic platform runs through their agendas, but it wasn't always like that. Fifteen years ago, it was like we were on the outside looking in."Even now that their party enjoys unified control in Washington, the two have had to fight for their issues to be addressed. As Mr. Biden prepared to unveil his stimulus plan, Ms. DeLauro heard that the child tax credit, a proposal she first introduced 18 years ago this month, was not part of it. She swung into action, staying up late calling a list of top White House officials — including Ron Klain, the chief of staff; Susan E. Rice, the director of the Domestic Policy Council; and Steve Ricchetti, Mr. Biden's counselor — until she won agreement to include it. "I wasn't going to take no for an answer," Ms. DeLauro said.Across the Capitol, Ms. Murray, now the chairwoman of the Senate health and education committee, was strategizing with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, on how to keep Democrats united as they maneuvered the measure through the chamber. She and her staff were also part of efforts to hammer out major provisions in the stimulus package, including a substantial temporary expansion of subsidies purchased under the Affordable Care Act and the terms of a significant portion of the bill's school funding."It's so clear that you can come here and bring those issues up and people nod, 'Yes, that's good,'" Ms. Murray said. "But you don't get it as a priority. You don't get it in a legislative package. You don't get to vote.""But now we have more women here who have been working," she added. "They are here, and they're giving us the vote, and it's just awesome."For both lawmakers, the work is deeply personal.Ms. DeLauro remembers returning home one Friday night as a child to find her family's furniture on the street. They had been evicted, and they went to live with her grandmother until they had regained their financial footing.She still carries the feeling with her into the halls of Congress, and the needs of struggling families are never far from her priorities during negotiations, she said."It's not that my male colleagues don't think of these things," Ms. DeLauro said. "But just a reminder — we bring to it a sense of what is important to families, what's important to kids."As a teenager in Washington, Ms. Murray and her family, including six siblings, relied for months on food stamps after her father's illness prevented him from working. Her first foray into politics, famously, was an episode in which she said she was dismissed by a state lawmaker as a "mom in tennis shoes" who would fail in her efforts to beat back budget cuts targeting a preschool program. She embraced the label and has campaigned on it ever since."All of these issues are things that are lived experiences of a lot of Americans," Ms. Murray said. Her focus, she added, has been on policies that ensure that Americans feel "that there's a place for them in this country that allows them to be able to work and take care of their families at the same time."Children "are the reason she wakes up every day — they are the most important thing in her life and in her profession," said Mike Spahn, a former chief of staff. "She is only in politics because she was personally motivated by the impact that government policy had on the lives of children."Ms. Murray was a state senator in 1991 when Anita Hill testified before the all-male Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Clarence Thomas. Ms. Murray watched Ms. Hill testify about the sexual harassment she said she had experienced working for Judge Thomas and found herself inspired to run for the Senate."I sat hundreds of miles — thousands of miles — away, and I'm thinking these people don't speak to the issue," Ms. Murray recalled in an interview. "There's nobody sitting in the Senate who can fight for what I believe in, because they don't know it."A year later, she was among the four women newly elected to the Senate, setting a record in what would become known as the Year of the Woman. (There are now two dozen women serving there; Ms. Murray is the second-most senior.)"I think a lot of the male senators were really afraid of that — afraid of us," she recalled. "'Oh, my God, what are they going to do? Are they going to burn the streets down here?' Frequently Asked Questions About the New Stimulus PackageHow big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible?Thestimuluspayments would be $1,400 for most recipients. Those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. To qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. For heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. To be eligible for a payment, a person must have a Social Security number. Read more. What would the relief bill do about health insurance?Buying insurance through the government program known as COBRA would temporarily become a lot cheaper. COBRA, for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. But it's expensive: Under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. Under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire COBRA premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. A person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before Sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. And someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either. Read moreWhat would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit? This credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. More people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. The bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. "That will be helpful to people at the lower end" of the income scale, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Read more.What student loan changes are included in the bill?There would be a big one for people who already have debt. You wouldn't have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you've been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if Congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. This would be the case for debt forgiven between Jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025. Read more.What would the bill do to help people with housing?The bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. About $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. The vast majority of it would replenish the so-called Coronavirus Relief Fund, created by the CARES Act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments,accordingto the National Low Income Housing Coalition. That's on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in December. To receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet severalconditions. Household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. Assistance could be provided for up to 18 months,accordingto the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance. She recalled one of her male colleagues being baffled when she abandoned a Senate vote to go care for her son, who had gotten sick at school.Ms. Murray quickly learned the ropes, becoming practiced at cutting deals with Republicans and inserting critical provisions into unwieldy bills. She honed her skills as a legislative tactician with the help of two fellow Democrats who were masters of Senate procedure and policymaking: Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who led the health and education committee, wielding the same gavel Ms. Murray now holds.When an ailing Mr. Byrd was no longer able to manage the procedural minutiae of the Senate's annual appropriations process — a sprawling, tedious and crucial task — it was Ms. Murray who stood in for him."She really learned the inside game and the art of lawmaking," Mr. Spahn said. "There are a ton of incredible advocates, but there are fewer and fewer who know how to translate that into not just policy, but law, and she learned from that old-school crew who are in the hall of fame."While Ms. Murray is a distinctly quiet and private figure, Ms. DeLauro is her opposite. Known for her vivid hand gestures, often accentuated by statement jewelry and scarves — and a shock of colorful dyed hair in her signature bob — Ms. DeLauro is a whirlwind of energy on the House floor.She followed in the footsteps of her parents, who were local government officials in New Haven and often opened the family's kitchen table to neighbors — many fellow Italian immigrants — who needed help. Ms. DeLauro gravitated to public service.She went to work for Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, serving as his chief of staff for seven years before going over to Emily's List, a political action committee that works to elect Democratic women. In 1990, Ms. DeLauro ran herself, winning a House seat representing a district in central Connecticut that included her native New Haven.Once in Washington, Ms. DeLauro became a close ally of a Democratic House member from California, Nancy Pelosi, long before Ms. Pelosi ascended to the speakership. Over the years, Ms. DeLauro climbed the ranks of the Appropriations Committee while remaining in Ms. Pelosi's tightly knit circle of advisers. She is now the second woman to lead the panel. While she is unapologetically liberal, Ms. DeLauro also has the pragmatic impulses of a veteran of high-stakes legislative fights.The stimulus talks tested that approach. Because of the strict budget rules that govern the reconciliation process that Democrats employed to move the bill through the Senate without any Republican votes, Ms. DeLauro and Ms. Murray could not secure a permanent expansion of the child tax credit or the new Affordable Care Act subsidies.They took part of a loaf, making the provisions temporary and setting up what promises to be a bruising political fight next year over whether to extend them. As Mr. Biden readies a two-part infrastructure plan that is expected to include a significant investment in child care and supporting women in the labor force, both lawmakers are likely to play a large role in shepherding it through Congress."If something is not to be, and you can't get it done, then you look for the way in which it can partially get it done," Ms. DeLauro said. "What are the things can you get, so it's not my way or the highway? That's not what the legislative body is all about."

MANSHIYET RUGOLA, Egypt — The gargantuan container ship that has blocked world trade by getting stuck aslant the Suez Canal has towered over Umm Gaafar's dusty brick house for five days now, humming its deep mechanical hum.She looked up from where she sat in the bumpy dirt lane and considered what the vessel, the Ever Given, might be carrying in all those containers. Flat-screen TVs? Full-sized refrigerators, washing machines or ceiling fans? Neither she nor her neighbors in the village of Manshiyet Rugola, population 5,000-ish, had any of those at home."Why don't they pull out one of those containers?" joked Umm Gaafar, 65. "There could be something good in there. Maybe it could feed the town."The Japanese-owned Ever Given and the more than 300 cargo ships now waiting to traverse the Suez Canal, one of the world's most critical shipping arteries, could supply Manshiyet Rugola many, many times over.Hauling cars, oil, livestock, laptops, jet fuel, scrap metal, grain, sweaters, sneakers, appliances, toilet paper, toys, medical equipment and much more, the vessels were supposed to supply much of the world, and the canal was to have been their quickest path from Asia and the Middle East to Europe and the east coast of the United States.Canal authorities said on Saturday that dredgers had managed to dig out the rear of the ship on Friday night, freeing its rudder, and that by Saturday afternoon they had dredged 18 meters down into the canal's eastern bank, where the ship's bow was stuck solid. But after a salvage team failed once more to dislodge the four-football-field-long leviathan from the sand bank where it ran aground on Tuesday, blocking all shipping traffic through the canal, global supply chains churned closer to a full-blown crisis. Already, shipping analysts estimated, the colossal traffic jam was holding up nearly $10 billion in trade every day."All global retail trade moves in containers, or 90 percent of it," said Alan Murphy, the founder of Sea-Intelligence, a maritime data and analysis firm. "So everything is impacted. Name any brand name, and they will be stuck on one of those vessels."Easing the bottleneck depends on the salvagers' ability to clear away the sand, mud and rock where the Ever Given is stuck and to lighten the ship's load enough to help it float again, all while tugboats try to push and pull it free. Their best chance may arrive on Monday, when a spring tide will raise the canal's water level by up to about 18 inches, analysts and shipping agents said.The company that oversees the ship's operations and crew, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said 11 tugboats were helping, with two more due on Sunday. Several dredgers, including a specialized suction dredger that can extract 2,000 cubic meters of material per hour, were digging around the vessel's bow, the company said. From the deck of a tugboat, where the Egyptian authorities allowed journalists to glimpse the salvage operation for the first time on Saturday evening, several boats that barely reached halfway up the ship's side were visible, nosed up to the ship to keep it stable. Dredgers and heavy equipment stood toylike under floodlights by the ship's bow. A powerful tugboat sat near the ship's stern, waiting for the next re-floating attempt. But high tide, which was forecast for a little after 10:30 p.m., came and went without progress.Much of the work, however, was invisible. The team of eight Dutch salvage experts and naval architects overseeing the operation will need to survey the ship and the seabed and create a computer model that will help it work around the vessel without damaging it, said Capt. Nick Sloane, a South African salvage master who led the operation to right the Costa Concordia, the cruise ship that capsized in 2012 off the coast of Italy.They will need to clear other vessels from the area, a massive coordination effort. And they will need to account for the possibility that the Ever Given's grounding has rearranged the seabed, making it harder for other ships to pass through the area even after it has been moved, said Capt. Paul Foran, a marine consultant who has worked on other salvage operations.All the while, they must hope the Ever Given remains intact. With the ship sagging in the middle, its bow and stern both caught in positions for which it was not designed, the hull is vulnerable to stress and cracks, both experts said.Mohammed Mosselhy, the owner of First Suez International, a maritime logistics company at the canal, said teams of divers were already inspecting the hull and had not yet found damage. But in most other respects, the Ever Given had succumbed to Murphy's Law: Everything that could go wrong did, starting with the ship's size, among the world's largest."It was the biggest ship in the convoy, and she ended up in the worst part of the canal" — a narrow section with only one lane, Captain Sloane said. "And that was just really unfortunate."If the tugboats, dredgers and pumps cannot get the job done, they could be joined by a head-spinning array of specialized vessels and machines requiring perhaps hundreds of workers: small tankers to siphon off the ship's fuel; the tallest cranes in the world to unload some of its containers one by one; and, if no cranes are tall enough or near enough, heavy-duty helicopters that can pick up containers of up to 20 tons — though no one has said where the cargo would go. (A full 40-foot container can weigh up to 40 tons.)Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, said at a news conference on Saturday that while he hoped "we don't reach that stage," the authorities would summon ships with cranes to transfer some of the containers.Though canal authorities and analysts sounded optimistic that the canal would be cleared this weekend, Capt. Sloane estimated that the operation would take at least a week. When a similarly sized ship, the CSCL Indian Ocean, ran aground near the port of Hamburg in 2016, it took nearly six days to clear the Elbe River.All this because, to put it simply: "This is a very big ship; this is a very big problem," said Richard Meade, the editor in chief of Lloyd's List, a London-based maritime intelligence publication. "I don't think there's any question they've got everything they need. It's just a question of, it's a very big problem."If the ship breaks free by Monday, the shipping industry can absorb the inconvenience, analysts said, but beyond that, supply chains and consumers could start to see major disruptions.Some ships have already decided not to wait, U-turning out of Suez to take the long way around the southern tip of Africa, a journey that could add weeks to the journey and cost more than $26,000 per extra day in fuel costs.On Saturday, General Rabie defended the canal's safety record: 18,840 ships in 2020, zero accidents."What happened happens all over the world, and it will happen again," he said. "The Suez Canal, as a passage, has nothing to do with the incident."In Manshiyet Rugola, whose name translates to "Little Village of Manhood," traffic jams of any kind would be difficult to imagine in usual times.Donkey carts piled high with clover bumped down semi-paved lanes between low brick houses and green fields lined with palm trees, trash and animal dung. A teenager hawked ice cream from his motorcycle. Roosters offered profane competition to the noontime call to prayer. Until the Ever Given showed up, the minarets of the unimposing mosques were the tallest structures around."Do you want to see the ship?" a young boy asked a pair of visiting journalists, bobbing in excitement under the window of their car. Ever since the earthquake-like rumble of the ship running aground jolted many awake around 7 a.m. Tuesday, the Ever Given had been the only topic in town."The whole village was out there watching," said Youssef Ghareeb, 19, a factory worker. "We've gotten so used to having her around, because we've been living on our rooftops just watching the ship for four days."It was universally agreed that the view was even better at night, when the ship glowed with light: a skyscraper right out of a big-city skyline, lying on its side."When it lights up at night, it's like the Titanic," said Nadia, who, like her neighbor Umm Gaafar, declined to give her full name because of the security forces in the area. "All it's missing is the necklace from the movie."Umm Gaafar had asked to go by her nickname so as not to run afoul of the government security personnel who had passed through, warning residents not to take photos of the canal and generally spreading unease. Nadia said she was too intimidated to take pictures of the ship at night, though she badly wanted to.Villagers and shipping analysts had the same question about the Ever Given, if rooted in different expertise. The ship's operators have insisted that the ship ran aground because of the high winds of a sandstorm, with the stacked containers acting like a giant sail, yet other ships in the same convoy passed through without incident. So had previous ships in previous storms, the villagers pointed out."We've seen worse winds," said Ahmad al-Sayed, 19, a security guard, "but nothing like that ever happened before."Two pilots from the Suez Canal typically board large ships transiting the canal to help guide them through, though they are steered by a member of the crew, said Captain Foran, the maritime consultant.Shipping experts and government officials said the wind could well have been a factor, exacerbating other physical forces, but they suggested that human error may have come into play. "A significant incident like this is usually the result of many reasons: The weather was one reason, but maybe there was a technical error, or a human error," General Rabie said on Saturday.Captain Foran had had the same idea."I am highly questioning, why was it the only one that went aground?" he said. "But they can talk about all that later. Right now, they just have to get that beast out of the canal."Nada Rashwan contributed reporting.

ARVADA, Colo. — Two decades after they left Syria for a new home in the Rocky Mountains, it looked from the outside as if the Alissa family had made it in America.After years of moving from rental to rental, they bought a seven-bedroom gabled home in the Denver suburbs near golf courses and walking trails. Their children attended high-rated schools. The family ran a handful of Middle Eastern restaurants across the Denver area where customers raved about the lamb kebabs and the pillowy pitas. Friends recalled the big, multigenerational family as hard-working and generous.But there were also signs of turbulence. Court records showed that some members of the family had faced evictions, had been cited for reckless endangerment and had run-ins with the police over the years. A real-estate dispute within the family had spilled into court. There were tensions with neighbors about noise, toddlers from the Alissas' home wandering into the street with no adults in sight and cars screeching in and out of their driveway.Whatever its complications, the Alissa family's story of immigrant striving has now become yoked to a distinctly American tragedy of mass murder after Ahmad Alissa, 21, was charged with gunning down 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder, Colo.The young man who was a daily presence in the family's lives — living in an upstairs bedroom of the family home, working at the family's Sultan Grill restaurant — has now become the urgent focus of a wide-ranging criminal investigation.Nearly a week after the shooting, investigators say they are still searching to understand Mr. Alissa's motives and do not know why he chose a supermarket 15 miles from his home.Detectives have not yet fully combed through his electronic devices and other evidence — a process that could take days or more — and Mr. Alissa is not talking to law enforcement personnel, according to a person briefed on the investigation.A lawyer for Mr. Alissa said in court that Mr. Alissa had an unspecified mental illness, echoing public statements his older brother Ali had made asserting that Mr. Alissa was paranoid and had delusions of being watched and followed.Now, the suspect's family has gone quiet in public. They have vanished from their home in the Westwoods subdivision of Arvada, neighbors said. They declined multiple requests for comment.This account of the family's life was pieced together through court records, police reports and interviews with neighbors, former classmates of Mr. Alissa and family friends. Most spoke on the condition they not be identified because they did not want to be tied to a mass murder.The Sultan Grill, the Middle Eastern restaurant in Arvada the Alissas once declared was "proudly founded by an immigrant family more than 10 years ago!" has gone dark since the shootings. Some people have posted angry online reviews condemning the family. But a number of customers have left notes of sympathy and flowers at the door, and friends said the family did not deserve to be blamed for the murders."This could destroy their lives, their businesses, everything they've worked so hard for," said Michelle Archuleta, 42, whose daughter had been in a long-term relationship with Imad Alissa, an older brother of the defendant.Ms. Archuleta said her daughter had spent four years living with the Alissa family and had worked at another of their restaurants, the Amir Grill, in the foothills town of Golden, Colo. She said her daughter and Imad Alissa had been wed in a traditional Muslim ceremony but had never legally married.Ms. Archuleta said she had found an outgoing and friendly family when she went to the Alissas' home for birthdays and dinners. There were children playing everywhere, and the younger generation who grew up in the United States would translate for their mother, who did not speak English. Ms. Archuleta said she remembered Ahmad Alissa as quiet and verging on antisocial. But she said her daughter, who died in 2020, had never raised any concerns."We never thought anything was wrong," Ms. Archuleta said.The 21-year-old man now charged with adding another bloody chapter to Colorado's history of mass shootings was born in Syria, just three days before the attacks on Columbine High School in 1999.On a now-deactivated Facebook page, Mr. Alissa said he had moved to the United States in 2002, years before a vicious civil war turned millions of Syrians into refugees. The Syrian cities that some in his family name as their hometowns — Aleppo and Raqqa — became bombed-out battlegrounds and a haven for the Islamic State as Mr. Alissa and his siblings were growing up and starting businesses in the United States.The Alissas were part of a tiny Syrian diaspora in Colorado. Arab-Americans make up less than 1 percent of the state's population, and most of those who identify as "Arab" on census surveys say they are from Iraq, Somalia or Sudan. Just 324 Syrian refugees were resettled in Colorado in the last 40 years, according to data from the Colorado Department of Human Services.Public records identify Mr. Alissa's father as Moustafa Alissa, 62, and social-media profiles and interviews indicate that Ahmad was one of at least seven siblings. Several of his older brothers found a foothold in the restaurant business, opening food trucks that later grew into restaurants.Records show that at various times, the Alissa brothers also ventured into a car-service business and — at one point — junk removal. A brother-in-law, Usame Almusa, a recent immigrant from Syria, filed corporate papers to form yet another restaurant business. The family moved at least three times over the past two decades, from the largely middle-class city of Aurora to an apartment in Denver to a rental in Arvada, where a former neighbor remembers family members sometimes stopping by to ask questions about the suburban chores of lawns and weeding.Mr. Alissa had barely started at Denver South High School when the family moved again, and he had to transfer to first one high school, then another, in the nearby city of Arvada. They moved into their current home, a seven-bedroom, 7,400-square-foot house in a quiet subdivision, in 2017, according to public records, and paid $634,000. One of the older brothers, Ali, 34, is listed as its owner.At Arvada West High School, Mr. Alissa joined the wrestling team and often went to the gym with his friends. His classmates described him as someone who had only a few friends, often talking about his interest in science and the books of Stephen Hawking. He had been bullied during his earlier years in school, one friend said, and several said he had a volatile temper. What to Know About Gun Laws and Shootings in the U.S.In the last five years, there have been at least 29 shootingsin the United States with four or more fatalities, according to data compiled by the Violence Project. The number of overall injuries from firearms reached a 50-year high in 2017, with nearly 40,000 people killed.Americans make up about 4.4 percent of the global population but own 42 percent of the world's guns. Research shows that 31 percent of mass shootings worldwide from 1966 to 2012 were committed by Americans.The Times examined how weapons were obtainedin 19 shootings from 2009 to 2018. Many of the guns used in mass shootings are bought legally and with a federal background check.At the state level, there is a checkerboard of gun laws that align with the partisan tilt of each state. While 13 Democratic-controlled states have restricted gun access in recent years, 14 Republican states have loosened their gun laws. During his senior year in November 2017, Mr. Alissa suddenly and without warning began punching a classmate in the head, continuing to strike him even after the boy had fallen defenseless to the floor. An Arvada police officer who was working in the school found the boy bleeding from his nose and mouth, throwing up, with his right eye swollen shut, according to an account from the officer.Mr. Alissa told the school's principal that the classmate had been bullying him for the past year, calling him a "terrorist" and other racist names, claims that the classmate denied at the time and again this past week when reports about the assault surfaced in the wake of the shooting. Mr. Alissa wrote in a statement at the time that he did not remember much of the assault and that he had "blacked out and rushed" the classmate, according to the police report.Mr. Alissa was suspended from school for about two weeks and pleaded guilty in court to a charge of misdemeanor assault. He was sentenced to one year of probation and 48 hours of community service.While acquaintances describe Mr. Alissa's large extended family as outwardly harmonious, there were signs of friction.In 2014, Ahmad's older brother Imad pleaded guilty in Denver to carrying a concealed weapon, records show. He was arrested again four years later on a charge of possession of a weapon by a previous offender, though prosecutors did not pursue charges.In 2016, a female member of the family pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless endangerment and was given a deferred sentence after she agreed to take a parenting class.In 2018, the Arvada police responded to a call at the house that stemmed from a dispute between Imad Alissa and his wife, Ms. Archuleta's daughter. The couple had broken up (they later reconciled, Ms. Archuleta said), and a fight over a torn mattress had escalated to the point that the police were called.Nobody was charged with any crime, but in the course of investigating the call, officers also happened to speak with a member of the family — Ahmad, who gave his own account of who had ripped the mattress.Then, earlier this year, in January, two of the brothers, Ali and Muhamad Alissa, filed a lawsuit in Denver against one of their sisters, Aicha, and her husband, Mr. Almusa, the recent immigrant from Syria.The dispute is over a Denver home, purchased jointly by the four. The brothers want to sell the home, but their relatives living there are opposed.A lawyer for the Alissa brothers declined to comment, as did Mr. Almusa.Over the past week, those who knew Mr. Alissa in high school have been trying to reconcile their memories of a sometimes affable, sometimes angry wrestler and martial-arts fanatic with the obese, shirtless man who was dragged out of the grocery store by the police, blood spilling from a gunshot wound to his leg.One former wrestling teammate of Mr. Alissa's at Denver South High School, which Mr. Alissa attended before moving to Arvada, said Mr. Alissa would sometimes miss practices when they wrestled together in the winter of 2014-15 and that he had been far from a standout athlete but that he had never made any waves on the team.Mr. Alissa seemed to vanish, former classmates said, after his graduation in 2018."What happened in those four years since graduating is what's on everyone's mind," said Bruce Niyonkuru, the former teammate.Investigators have unearthed a few ominous glimpses of his life just before the shooting.Six days before the attack, Mr. Alissa bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol, a handgun that resembles a shortened assault-style rifle, from a gun store just three miles from the family home. About two days before the attack, a relative saw him back at the family home, playing with what she told the police looked like a "machine gun."After the attack, the Mercedes C-class sedan that was often seen parked in the driveway of the large family house was one of the cars left in the parking lot at the King Soopers grocery, along with all of the other cars whose owners would not be driving them home. An empty rifle case was left in the passenger compartment.Jack Healy reported from Arvada, Colo., Ali Watkins from Boulder, Colo., and Stephanie Saul, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Sara Aridi from New York.

Beachy and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.

Last week, the CNN anchor Brianna Keilar found herself, for the second time in under a week, guiding viewers through the grim ritual of trying, and failing, to make sense of another mass shooting.This time, it was 10 people dead at a grocery store in Boulder, Colo. Only a few days before, she had interviewed a survivor of the rampage at Atlanta-area massage parlors. In 2019, Ms. Keilar reported on the back-to-back shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. In 2018, she spoke with relatives of students killed in the shooting in Parkland, Fla. Broadcast journalists like Ms. Keilar, 40, have now spent the bulk of their reporting careers chronicling an unending, uniquely American horror show: the random gun massacre. She was CNN's first journalist to arrive on the Virginia Tech campus in 2007. And she was a college freshman in 1999, watching the network's coverage of a catastrophe at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.All this was running through Ms. Keilar's mind on Tuesday when, on-air, she paused after a correspondent's report about Rikki Olds, the 25-year-old Boulder supermarket manager who was murdered. "I just wonder, can you count how many times you've covered a story like this?" she asked, her voice catching. "Have you lost count?""I just was having this awful feeling of déjà vu," Ms. Keilar said in an interview, as she recalled the emotional broadcast, which was widely shared on social media. "If you're covering this all the time, it's possible to become numb. Because it becomes somehow unremarkable. This thing that is completely unacceptable, and should be extraordinary, becomes unremarkable."Journalists who have reported on multiple mass shootings say these moments are borne of sadness, frustration, and, for some, a feeling of futility in the face of a bleak kind of repetition. There is now a well-developed playbook that network correspondents and newspaper writers, including many New York Times reporters, turn to as they travel to yet another afflicted town. Talk to those who knew the victims and the gunman; attend vigils and funerals; gather information from the police and the courts. Balance necessary reporting on the attack with the potential that too much attention could be seen as glorifying the attacker."I call it the checklist: the shock, the horror, the outrage," Lester Holt, the anchor of "NBC Nightly News," said in an interview. "It's all so familiar, and everybody knows the role to play and the questions to answer and how these things play out. Because sadly, they are very predictable."Mr. Holt, who has reported on shootings in El Paso; Las Vegas; Newtown, Conn.; Orlando; Santa Fe, Texas; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Sutherland Springs, Texas — a lengthy but by no means exhaustive list — said he was considering this month's violence in Colorado and Georgia in light of the country's slow return to normal from the coronavirus pandemic."Shootings," he said, "are part of what normalcy looks like in this country, sadly."Journalists who reported on Columbine may not have considered how routine the event they were covering would become. For his book on the shooting, "Columbine," Dave Cullen analyzed media coverage and found that in the immediate aftermath of the Littleton attack, network news shows broadcast more than 40 segments, CNN and Fox News notched historically high ratings, and The Times mentioned Columbine on its front pages for nearly two straight weeks.Mr. Cullen, in an interview, said he believed that reporters had absorbed useful lessons since that first episode. "In 1999, everything we heard, we took as gospel; conjecture turned to fact very quickly," he said.After Columbine, news organizations were quick to formalize what Mr. Cullen called "myths" about the shooting: that the killers were bullied Goth kids taking revenge on popular jocks. Much of that narrative came from faulty sourcing, and Mr. Cullen said he saw journalists now being more cautious about reaching premature conclusions about an assailant's motivations. "We take things with a grain of salt," he said. "There was no salt in 1999."Reporters have learned to spend more time focusing on victims, rather than perpetrators. It was a shift that played out vocally on social media, as readers on Twitter implored news organizations to focus more on the people who were killed in the Atlanta shootings, as well as the uptick in crimes against Asian-Americans, rather than the gunman's supposed motive.Mr. Cullen recalled a journalism conference in 2005 where he raised the notion that reporters should refrain from focusing too much on the gunman. "I practically got shouted off the stage," he said. "Now, when I mention the names of a shooter from an older case on television, I will get angry tweets from people. The public expectation has changed."Journalists are usually expected to set their feelings aside as they gather disinterested facts about a tragic event. But it's not always possible, and Mr. Holt said that it was important to "report these things as unusual, as not normal.""I think it's OK to be a little pissed off," Mr. Holt, of "NBC Nightly News," said. "As a journalist, it's not an editorial position to be upset or angry at mass murder, of people going about their day, shopping, getting cut down by a stranger. It's OK to be upset about that."Gayle King, the "CBS This Morning" anchor, described an experience of feeling "like you're kicked in the gut once again.

We almost know how this story is going to go," she said, invoking a phrase she attributed to Steve Hartman, a CBS colleague: "We're going to mourn, we're going to pray, we're going to repeat.""My worry is that we are getting desensitized," she added. "I don't want us to get desensitized to it."And some reporters have to endure it, and report on it, repeatedly in their own communities.Chris Vanderveen, 47, was there as a young reporter in the aftermath of the Columbine shooting. He was there to report on the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting. And he had to lead a team of reporters during the Boulder shooting on Monday."When I was in journalism school I thought I'd be covering other things," Mr. Vanderveen, the director of reporting at KUSA, Denver's NBC affiliate, said in an interview. He recalled painful lessons that he and his colleagues took from the Columbine shooting. Several reporters who covered that event developed close ties with people in the community, including parents of the victims. He said that helped them ask an important question: "What can we learn as journalists about not adding to the grief?" After Aurora, KUSA invited family members of victims to the station. They were not there for an interview. "No story, no nothing," he said. "Just to help us with our coverage." Mr. Vanderveen said that through those conversations, the station decided not to show the same mug shot of the gunman over and over again. And he said he continued to consider the role the news media played in potentially inspiring future killers. "I worry that there are people out there that for a variety of reasons may want recognition, and then they see this heavy emphasis on an individual who keeps getting his picture shown," he said.On Monday, Mr. Vanderveen was in a meeting about an investigative story when word came from a producer: There had been gunshots at a grocery store in Boulder. Grim experience quickly kicked in."Every journalist goes through tough stories," he said. "We are not alone with it. It's just unfortunate that we've had in Colorado, a number of these, that have given us, for lack of a better term, training in how to try to deal with these things. But it's still going to be awful."His team of reporters may be among the few people in the news media covering the aftermath of the massacre, which he knows from experience will be a difficult assignment. After Columbine, national reporters stayed in the area for months. After Aurora, they stayed for a few weeks, he said. He suspects it will only be a matter of days before national news outlets leave Boulder."Maybe the country is tired of them," he said. "I'm tired of them. If I never got to cover one of these damn things again, I'll be fine." "But nothing changes," he added. "That's what drives me nuts. Nothing changes."

WASHINGTON — Dr. Bindi J. Naik-Mathuria, a pediatric trauma surgeon at Texas Children's Hospital who grew tired of seeing toddlers die of gunshot wounds, has a $684,000 federal grant to track every gun-related death and injury in Houston. The goal: identify and address "hot spots" the way epidemiologists track and contain the coronavirus.Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency room doctor and longtime firearm violence researcher in California, is supervising scientific research on whether community interventions in Detroit and Cleveland — including the greening of vacant spaces and the work of so-called violence interrupters like former gang members — can drive down gun-related deaths and injuries.And Andrew R. Morral, a behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, a research group, is using sophisticated modeling tools to estimate rates of gun ownership in every state, with detailed demographic information. The purpose, he said, is to search for patterns in firearm homicides and suicides — a first, basic step in research that could lead to reducing them.The recent mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colo., have once again left Democrats and Republicans in a stalemate over background checks for gun buyers and assault weapons bans. But public health experts say a new round of research could pave the way for gun policies that avoid partisan gridlock — and ultimately save thousands of lives.The studies by Dr. Naik-Mathuria and the others are being paid for by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is once again funding research into gun violence after a nearly 25-year hiatus imposed by Congress. And while they might not reduce the number of massacres, mass shootings account for an extremely small percentage of the roughly 40,000 Americans who die each year from gun violence."There's at least five different gun violence problems in the country and mass shooting is one of them," said Mr. Morral, who has a Ph.D. in psychology. "There's also suicide, there's urban gun violence which mostly affects minority young men, there's family shootings and there's police shootings. And they all have different risk factors, they all have very different motives and they often involve different firearms."Like cancer, there is no single cure for the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. If politicians want to make a difference, experts say, lawmakers need to quit the fruitless fights over whether liberals want to take people's guns away and start financing — and listening to — research that could inform policies that could address the carnage."It's not either, 'Keep your guns or prevent gun violence,' " said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who helped establish the C.D.C.'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control but said he was fired in the late 1990s under pressure from Republicans who opposed the center's gun research. "There's a strategy that science can help us define where you can do both — you can protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and at the very same time reduce the toll of gun violence."Federal money for gun research all but disappeared after Congress in 1996 enacted the so-called Dickey Amendment, which barred the C.D.C. from spending money to "advocate or promote gun control." It was named for Jay Dickey, a former Republican House member from Arkansas, who proudly proclaimed himself the National Rifle Association's "point man" in Washington.In an extraordinary turn of events, Mr. Dickey, who died in 2017, befriended the man whose work he had cut off, Dr. Rosenberg. The pair grew so close that Dr. Rosenberg gave the eulogy at Mr. Dickey's funeral.In 2019, Dr. Rosenberg and Mr. Dickey's former wife, Betty, a retired former prosecutor and chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, helped persuade Congress to restore the funding; lawmakers appropriated $25 million, split between the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health, for firearm injury prevention research.The agencies are now financing nearly two dozen studies, though backers of the research say the money is a pittance compared with the breadth of the problem."Millions of dollars have been put forth trying to figure out how do we eradicate cancer; we've got to be able to do the same with gun violence," said Representative Lucy McBath, Democrat of Georgia, who won election in 2018 by promising to end gun violence after her 17-year-old son was shot and killed."We've got to be able to give the C.D.C. and the N.I.H. the ability to study the implications and get that raw data, the grave implications of gun violence," she added, "just like we do in any other public health crisis."Treating gun violence as a public health problem is not a new idea. In 1991, Dr. Rosenberg's program awarded a research grant to an investigator who published a landmark study in The New England Journal of Medicine that found having a gun in the home tripled the risk of gun homicides and quintupled the risk of gun suicides.After it was published, the National Rifle Association took aim. The Dickey Amendment was a compromise between Democrats who wanted more research and Republicans who wanted to shut down Dr. Rosenberg's center.Research on the effectiveness of gun policies is scant, and much of it is not rigorous enough to either prove or disprove that any of the legislation being debated in Washington would do any good, said Mr. Morral, who directs RAND's National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research and has done a comprehensive analysis of the serious scientific literature.The existing research suggests that one policy under consideration in Congress — expanding background checks — could make a difference. RAND has found "moderately good evidence that the current background checks system is helpful" in reducing violent crime, Mr. Morral said, and so "it seems logical to think that background checks on all sales might help more."There is also moderately good evidence, RAND found, that waiting periods for gun purchases reduce both suicide and violent crime. And there is strong — or what RAND calls "supportive" — evidence that laws requiring guns to be safely stored away from children reduce firearm injuries and deaths among young people.But while President Biden has claimed that the federal assault weapons ban that lasted from 1994 to 2004 "brought down these mass killings," the evidence of that is unclear. There are only a handful of studies, Mr. Morral said, and they do not "persuasively show a causal effect" — not because there is not one, he said, but because of shortcomings in the study design.After the recent development of coronavirus vaccines highlighted the importance of scientific research, Dr. Rosenberg said, the public is primed to accept the argument that gun violence research can save lives. He likened it to the hundreds of millions of dollars the federal government poured into studying motor vehicle deaths in the 1970s and '80s, which led to safety measures like seatbelt requirements and lower speed limits, saving millions of lives.That was the argument he used to help persuade Congress to appropriate money for gun violence research in 2019. The research itself was never banned outright, and in 2013, weeks after the massacre that killed 26 people at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, President Barack Obama directed the C.D.C. to reconsider funding studies on gun violence.The agency commissioned a report from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council outlining priorities, but little changed. By 2019, after Democrats reclaimed the House, liberal organizations like MoveOn.org were petitioning Congress to repeal the Dickey Amendment. Nearly every House Democrat signed on.But Dr. Rosenberg argued it should remain intact, to "provide cover for Republicans and gun-loving Democrats who can put money into the science and tell their constituents, 'This is not money for gun control.' "Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who led the House subcommittee that oversaw the C.D.C.'s budget at the time, said she put $50 million into the appropriations bill that year, but the Senate, controlled by Republicans, eliminated it. The two chambers agreed on $25 million as a compromise, but she said she hoped to double the funding this year.Dr. Naik-Mathuria, the Houston trauma surgeon, said she would like to see Washington address the problem of gun violence as a matter of injury prevention, not politics. She began researching methods to reduce gun violence about six years ago, she said, after seeing "kids come in dead because they shot themselves in the head when they found a gun at home."Her current study is aimed at determining risk factors for gun violence for children and adults, and her past work has led to some changes in medical practice, she said.Pediatricians in Texas, she said, are hesitant to talk about gun safety out of concern that "it would anger parents or become political." So she and her group made a broader safety video that tucked in messages about gun safety — like keeping guns locked and stored — with tips like how to keep children away from poison.Dr. Wintemute, who directs the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center in Sacramento, said he lost grant money after the Dickey Amendment was enacted. In the two decades that followed, he said, his work has been supported by the state of California, by foundations, as well as the N.I.H., which was not specifically named in the Dickey Amendment, and the Justice Department. He said he had also spent a little more than $2 million of his own money to continue the work.His program is receiving $744,000 from the C.D.C. this year to finance three studies. The new funding from the agency, he said, is drawing young scientists to the work.Still, he laments the time that has been lost."It's as if we had decided, 'Let's not do research on coronavirus, let's not do research on cancer or heart disease, let's just let this problem run its course,'" he said. "How many thousands of people are dead who would be alive today if that research had been allowed to continue 25 years ago?"

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center's Rainforest Investigations Network.RIO DE JANEIRO — The pilot was 3,000 feet over the Amazon, flying a small propeller plane on his maiden assignment for wildcat miners deep in the forest, when the lone engine cut out.He took a deep breath and scanned the vast emerald green canopy below. He had about five minutes, he calculated, to bring down the plane and its highly flammable cargo: 160 gallons of diesel fuel.He reported his imminent crash over a portable radio to whomever might be listening, noting that he was about halfway to his destination, a mine known as California.Then, as his plane barreled down, Antônio Sena aimed for a small valley lined with palm trees."There!" he recalls thinking. "Palm trees mean there is water, perhaps a river."Since becoming a pilot nine years earlier, Mr. Sena had heard countless stories about fatal crashes. But while his plane scraped a few trees and then smashed into the ground, Mr. Sena realized something exhilarating as he rolled to a halt: He had survived.He grabbed a pocketknife, a flashlight, a couple of lighters and a phone with little juice in the battery and scrambled away from the aircraft. Moments later, it burst into flames. Then he settled down to wait for his rescue.It was a long wait.At first, Mr. Sena recounted in a phone interview last week, he camped out next to the remains of the 48-year-old Cessna 210L, figuring it was his best chance of being spotted. And search pilots did, in fact, circle the area for several days — and then kept going."They flew right over, but couldn't see me," Mr. Sena said.He waved and screamed each time he heard the thud of propellers, but to no avail.Giving up his hopes of being rescued near the wreckage, Mr. Sena embarked on what turned out to be a 17-mile trek through the rainforest, home to jaguars, venomous insects and anacondas.Thirty-six days later, on March 6, he emerged to tell a story that has transfixed Brazilians — a rare piece of uplifting news for a nation badly in need of it after a year of being battered by the Covid-19 crisis.His account, though, also put a spotlight on Brazil's illegal mining industry, which has flourished in recent decades in Indigenous territories and other parts of the Amazon that are supposed to be sanctuaries. The illegal mine where he was headed is in the Maicuru reserve, where no human activities are allowed beyond those meant to protect the forest.Mr. Sena's ordeal began on Jan. 28, at a small airstrip in Pará state. His task, he said, was to ferry diesel fuel for miners in a remote region where they had built a makeshift landing strip.It was work he took only reluctantly, he said. Flying gigs had become scarce during the pandemic, and a small bar he ran in his native city, Santarém, was providing little income."I had to let go of my own standards to try to support myself through this tough period," he said, noting the working conditions were very unsafe. "I would never fly for wildcat mining again."After his plane crashed, when it became clear help was not going to come from the sky, Mr. Sena, 36, started walking.He turned on his dying phone one final time to launch a geolocation app and then, looking at the map, decided to head in the direction of the Paru River, some 60 miles away. It was the closest area he knew to be inhabited.For days, Mr. Sena walked only in the morning, using the sun's position to head eastward toward the river. After slogging through swamps and ducking under vines for hours, he would stop in the afternoon to set up a campsite, using palm trees and branches to shelter him from the rain.Mr. Sena knew that predators usually hunt near the water, where prey is abundant. So he slept on hills. But he was frequently besieged by packs of spider monkeys, which tried to destroy his precarious shelters."They are very territorial," he said. "I never want to cross their path again."The monkeys, however, were a godsend: After watching them eat a small, bright pink fruit called breu, Mr. Sena assumed it was safe for human consumption, and it became his main source of sustenance. Besides that, he ate three small, blue eggs from inambu birds, and little else.One afternoon about four weeks after the crash, when he had gone three days without eating, a buzzing noise stopped him in his tracks. Chain saw!Mr. Sena was thrilled, almost euphoric, he said, but decided it was wisest to stop there for the night. He feared he might get lost trying to locate the source of the sound as night fell."God, make them use this chain saw again," he remembers praying before lying down to sleep.The next morning, he heard it again, but only briefly. So he kept walking east, his sights set on the river. That afternoon, he saw a white tarpaulin, and then a man cracking nuts besides it.Mr. Sena had stumbled into the campsite of Brazil nut collectors.The group, led by Maria Jorge dos Santos Tavares, 67, had not collected nuts in that part of the rainforest for three years.But Ms. Santos Tavares's husband died in the pandemic, and as the family mourned, their debts grew. Under mounting financial pressure, they began searching deeper into the forest for nuts.By the time Ms. Santos Tavares encountered Mr. Sena, he had lost 55 pounds. So even before using the radio to call her daughter Mirian, who lives in a town, and asking her to contact the pilot's mother, she fed him and gave him shelter.At first, Mirian said, she had trouble convincing Mr. Sena's family that he was still alive. Then she told of her own family's struggles."We lost a life, and you gained one," she remembers telling one of Mr. Sena's relatives. "I suppose that's the way God wanted it."After delivering Mr. Sena to a police helicopter, Ms. Santos Tavares went back into the forest, where she intends to spend the next month collecting nuts.Reflecting on his ordeal, Mr. Sena said he walked away with a newfound appreciation for the rainforest, which is being razed every day by the illegal miners he briefly worked for."If I had fallen somewhere in a deserted plantation site, I wouldn't have water, shelter, or what to eat," he said. "The Amazon is so rich."

It's spring! And Passover! Chag sameach. Personally, I like to treat Passover as an opportunity to eat matzo brei, matzo ball soup and macaroons for dinner as often as possible. (I want to try Susan Spungen's new matzo frittata, too, in keeping with my preference for a denser brei.)Not all of the dishes below are appropriate for the holiday (looking at you, shrimp and orzo), but the chicken and shakshuka recipes absolutely are, and they are delicious under any circumstance. That chicken is so beautiful, you could even serve it as the main course for a Seder meal.[Sign up here to receive the Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter in your inbox every Friday.]How do you like your matzo brei? Any other thoughts, questions, concerns? I'm dearemily@nytimes.com. 1. Sheet-Pan Chicken With Shallots and GrapesYou could serve this sweet, savory and very simple recipe by Colu Henry directly from the sheet pan, or arranged on a platter for a more special presentation. It's gorgeous either way. If it's part of a Passover menu, this herb salad would be an ideal side. View this recipe. 2. Creamy One-Pot Mushroom and Leek PastaThis recipe by Hetty McKinnon uses only one pot — convenient for cleanup, of course, but also a strategy for deepening the flavors in the dish, as the pasta cooks in stock in the deglazed pan with the caramelized leeks and mushrooms.View this recipe. 3. Shakshuka With FetaMelissa Clark's shakshuka, a NYT Cooking classic, was inspired by a trip she took to Israel years ago that fell on Passover. Gastronomically, this was bad timing, given the dietary restrictions of the holiday. The silver lining was that she ate a lot of shakshuka: eggs baked in a thick, highly spiced tomato sauce. It's as good as it sounds.View this recipe._____4. Shrimp Scampi With OrzoI have been hearing for almost a year about how good this Ali Slagle recipe is. And: It is. I finally made it. In fact, it is dunk-your-bread-in-the-pan-sauces good. No-leftovers good.View this recipe. 5. Coconut-Miso Salmon CurryAnother bright and beloved NYT Cooking recipe — this one, by Kay Chun, has five stars, not just for its ease but for the deep flavor she produces with smart techniques. A wide range of seafood choices would work in place of the salmon.View this recipe.I hope you have a good week. Previous newsletters are archived here.

In "Anatomy of a Scene," we ask directors to reveal the secrets that go into making key scenes in their movies. See new episodes in the series on Fridays. You can also watch our collection of more than 150 videos on YouTube and subscribe to our YouTube channel.America as a land of promise, a land of hardship or a land of fun? All three perspectives are seen in this opening sequence from "Minari," Lee Isaac Chung's drama about a Korean family that moves to Arkansas to build a fresh life in the United States. It is nominated for six Academy Awards, including best picture.This sequence observes the Yi family (played by Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, Noel Kate Cho and Alan Kim) arriving at their new home, a trailer in the middle of a field. Yeun's character, Jacob, is proud and optimistic, while Han's Monica is skeptical.In an interview, Chung said that the scene was in his mind when he first began writing the screenplay and that the story would grow from there, a kind of hopeful emptiness that would be filled in."That's why it starts off at a house where it's not really furnished," he said. "There's not even any stairs there."Then Chung explored the different family members' perspectives through shots and dialogue, or the lack thereof. Jacob is the first character we see getting out of a vehicle. "I filmed that wanting to evoke the feeling of man getting off of his horse," Chung said. Then in directing Han, he told her that her performance would often be one of reactions rather than words. "Everything she has to convey has to be through her looks, her expressions, her gestures," he said. And with the kids, he told them to just "go out and have fun." He tried to capture their performances in a documentary style to give the movie a more free-form and less staged feeling.Read the "Minari" review.Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics' Picks and more.

If high-intensity exercise is good for us, is more necessarily better?Maybe not, according to an admonitory new study of the molecular effects of high-intensity interval training, also known as HIIT. In the study, people who began working out strenuously almost every day developed sudden and severe declines in the function of their mitochondria, which are the energy powerhouses inside of cells, along with incipient signs of blood sugar dysfunction.Their metabolic issues started to reverse when they dialed back on their workouts but did not disappear, suggesting that the benefits of extremely vigorous exercise may depend on just how much we do.At this point, almost anyone with an interest in fitness is familiar with the concept and appeal of high-intensity interval training. Consisting of repeated, brief spurts of hard exercise interspersed with a few minutes of rest, HIIT workouts can be quite short but are still able to improve substantially our aerobic fitness and many other aspects of our health. Studies show, for example, that intense bursts of exercise increase the number of mitochondria in our muscle cells, and more mitochondria are thought to contribute to better cellular and metabolic health.But recent research has begun to hint that HIIT also may have unexpected downsides. In a study I wrote about in January, people who worked out with HIIT routines three times a week for six weeks did not improve their blood pressure or body fat as much as people who exercised far more moderately five times a week.The authors of that study speculated that, by being sedentary for four days each week, the intense exercisers in the study may have undermined the otherwise potent effects of their HIIT sessions. On a weekly basis, they were not exercising enough.But whether it would be advisable to do more HIIT sessions in a single week has not been clear. Most past studies and formal recommendations about intense workouts top out at three sessions a week, and few researchers have looked into how HIIT-ing harder or more often might affect health.So, for the new study, which was published recently in the journal Cell Metabolism, researchers at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences and the Karolinska Institute, both in Stockholm, set out, like Goldilocks, to sample different amounts of weekly hard exercise and see if any might be just right.They began by recruiting 11 healthy men and women who exercised but were not competitive athletes. These volunteers visited the researchers' lab for tests of their current fitness and metabolic health, including blood-sugar levels over the course of a day.Then the volunteers began an ambitious exercise program. During the first week, they performed two sessions of HIIT, repeating four-minute-long intervals five times on a stationary bicycle, with three minutes of rest in between. The riders pedaled as hard as they could during each four-minute surge, while researchers monitored their power output. Afterward, the researchers biopsied leg muscles and rechecked the riders' fitness and 24-hour blood-sugar control.During week two, the riders added a third HIIT session and ramped up the length of some of their intervals to a draining eight minutes. In week three, they worked out five times, with a mix of four-minute and eight-minute spurts of all-out pedaling. Finally, in week four, for recovery, they effectively halved the amount and intensity of their exercise. Each week, the researchers repeated all testing.Then they compared how people's bodies had changed week over week.At first, the findings were encouraging. By the end of week two, the riders were pedaling harder and appeared to be getting fitter, with better daily blood-sugar control and more total mitochondria in their muscle cells. Each of these mitochondria was also more efficient now, producing greater amounts of energy than at the start.But something began to go wrong during week three. The volunteers' ability to generate power while cycling flattened, and their subsequent muscle biopsies showed sputtering mitochondria, each of which was now producing only about 60 percent as much energy as during the previous week. The riders' blood-sugar control also slipped, with seesawing spikes and dips throughout the day.After a week of lower-intensity riding, their mitochondria started to bounce back, producing more energy, but still 25 percent less than during week two. Their blood-sugar levels also stabilized, but again, not to the same extent as before. The riders could pedal, however, with the same — or even greater — vigor as in week two.Taken as a whole, the monthlong experiment suggests that "HIIT exercise should not be excessive if increased health is a desired outcome," says Mikael Flockhart, a doctoral student at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, who conducted the study with his adviser, Filip Larsen, and others.The study was not focused on athletic performance, but even for serious athletes, he says, piling on multiple, intense, interval workouts each week, with little rest between them, is likely to lead to a tipping point, after which performance, as well as indicators of metabolic health, slip.The researchers are not sure precisely what changes within their volunteers' bodies and muscles precipitated the negative results in week three. They tested multiple potential molecular causes, Mr. Flockhart says, but did not isolate an obvious, single instigator. He and his colleagues suspect that a cascade of biochemical changes within people's muscles during the hardest week of exercise overwhelmed the mitochondria then, and the weakened mitochondria contributed to the disruptions in people's blood-sugar control.This study was small, though, and quite short-term, with barely a week of each exercise routine. It also featured healthy volunteers, so does not show whether results would be the same, better or worse in people with existing metabolic problems.Even so, the findings strongly suggest that anyone interested in high-intensity interval training start small, Mr. Flockhart says. Train a few times a week and on the remaining days, maybe take a walk.

"I am not the quintessential image of a harpist," said Brandee Younger, 37, a classically trained harpist, composer and educator. Ms. Younger, who lives in Harlem, smiled audibly as she enumerated the common stereotypes of the stringed instrument. "You're blond, your eyes are blue … little naked baby angels," she said, joking. "It's just so not down to earth."Bringing the harp to the masses has been a central goal of Ms. Younger's career. Her jazz-infused compositions have been featured on works by pop and R&B's most recognizable names including Beyoncé, Stevie Wonder, John Legend and Lauryn Hill.For centuries the harp has been lodged in the domain of "serious" music — a niche instrument, perhaps dusted off for weddings and bottomless mimosa brunches. With such an entrenched reputation, could the harp ever be hip?It's not without precedent. Lizzo gave the flute a boost back in 2018 when she declared on Instagram "HO AND FLUTE ARE LIFE." Videos of the singer twerking while flawlessly tooting rap melodies quickly went viral, challenging stereotypical connotations of the flute as an instrument of purity and innocence.Thanks to a collection of emerging independent artists and social media musicians, the harp is also finding a new audience. And the instrument is turning up in some unexpected places, including PornHub movie soundtracks and heavily engaged TikTok posts.Ms. Younger's love affair with the instrument began when she was a girl growing up in the suburban enclave of Hempstead, N.Y., and heard a father's colleague play; she started lessons as a teenager. "The harp is one of the few instruments that creates sound with direct touch," she said. "There's no barrier between you and the sound."But as her musical career progressed, instead of solemnly plucking chamber music by Claude Debussy or Carlos Salzedo, Ms. Younger wanted to play the soulful music of her idols Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby, two Black female jazz harpists she has called the "lodestars" of her career."Not only are they playing this music that is just killing, but I want to play this stuff because it's so cool," Ms. Younger said. "They were women. They were Black. I was just connected to them on so many different levels."If Ms. Coltrane's liquid glissandos provided Ms. Younger ways to make harp music youthful and fresh, it was Ms. Ashby's transcendence of genre that set the blueprint for her career. Fans of rap and hip-hop have been unwittingly listening to Ms. Ashby's music for decades, with samples of her work used by Jay-Z, Mac Miller, Drake and other big names.Ms. Younger's most recent album, "Force Majeure," is a collection of livestream performances recorded with her longtime collaborator bassist Dezron Douglas. The album features an original jazz- and gospel-tinged composition, as well as covers of hit songs from Kate Bush and "Sesame Street.""We're making music for people," Ms. Younger said. "Sometimes you have to branch out of what you are used to doing or what you're trained to do."The StringfluencersThe harp is one of the oldest known instruments, and was widely played in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures. Later it became popular among the royal and aristocratic classes of Europe — Marie Antoinette regularly entertained guests at the French Court with her ornate gilded harp — and became a fixture in Victorian-era salons. Exhibiting proficiency in musical instruments like the harp was one way for women to prove they were worthy marriage material.The association of the harp with chastity and virtue has dogged modern players. Joanna Newsom, the indie singer-songwriter who catapulted the harp onto Billboard music charts with her acclaimed 2006 album, "Ys," has fought the stereotype of its music being all fairy tales and unicorns."It's an infantilizing thing that happens," Ms. Newsom told the British press upon the release of her 2015 album, "Divers." "The language is minimizing and narrowing of possible narrative depth."Marilu Donovan, 33, a harpist in New York, is also over the instrument's prudish rep. "It just becomes exhausting," she said. "It's an instrument. It's multifaceted. It can have so many different feels to it and still be beautiful."Ms. Donovan performs with Adam Markiewicz, a violinist and vocalist, under the name LEYA. The duo brings a punk mentality to their experimental work, which has been described by Pitchfork as "eerie, beckoning and tinged with horror." Ms. Donovan achieves this effect through unorthodox tunings and amplifications. The result creates an unearthly dissonance: the auditory equivalent of awakening in the fog of a bad dream only to discover you're still trapped in the nightmare.LEYA collaborates with their peers in the experimental music scene, recording tracks with Eartheater, a musician in Queens, and the Brooklyn black metal band Liturgy. Mary Lattimore, another contemporary harpist, also collaborates with musicians from other genres, including prominent indie rockers like Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and the Violators' Steve Gunn and Kurt Vile."When I started playing with LEYA we were playing these little noise shows in basements," Ms. Donovan said of the band's early touring appearances, giving a virtual tour of her apartment over Zoom.She stopped next to two towering pedal harps — one ivory and one walnut — made by the famed Lyon and Healy music company in Chicago. A harp from the manufacturer can weigh more than 80 pounds and costs, on average, over $30,000; $50,000 if it's gilded. It's the older ivory harp that Ms. Donovan takes touring. "People would spill their beer on my harp," she said. "People have fought during our shows."This same harp also makes a surprising cameo in the 2018 PornHub film "I Love You," directed by Brooke Candy, a stripper turned rapper who hired the band after seeing the video for their single "Sister."Cloaked under veils of crimson tulle, Ms. Donovan and Mr. Markiewicz play haunting melodies as artfully choreographed erotic scenes unfold onscreen. LEYA used several songs from that production for their 2020 album, "Flood Dream." "Brooke is just such a positive, good energy person," Ms. Donovan said of her experience on set. "It was so much fun."The harp's delicate curves have also found a wider audience on social media. Hannah Stater, a music student at the University of Michigan formerly known as @hannah_harpist on TikTok (she now uses her full name), has accumulated hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of likes on the platform. @hannahstater here's a little treat for all my @charlixcx fans #charlixcx #party4u #howimfeelingnow #hannahharpist ♬ original sound - Hannah Stater (she/her) Kristan Toczko, a Canadian harpist, was praised by the gaming community after Reddit went wild for her rendition of the Halo video game's theme song.Plenty of PluckWhen Madison Calley, who is in her 20s, started posting videos of her own harp performances to her social media profiles, she didn't expect to have even a fraction of that success.Ms. Calley, who lives in Los Angeles, had completed a recording session for Ariana Grande's "Positions" album. Then came the coronavirus and canceled concerts. Ms. Calley turned to Instagram to keep her skills sharp.A typical video shows Ms. Calley playing pop and R&B on a towering champagne-hued pedal harp in her spacious living room, dotted with various greenery and flooded with natural light. One of her earliest clips, a cover of Alicia Keys's song "Diary," was noticed by Ms. Keys, who reposted Ms. Calley's rendition to her millions of followers."I think once the pandemic hit everyone was on their phones looking for some escapism from all the craziness going on in the world," Ms. Calley said. "I had no idea it would take off the way it has."Soon, producers from the Latin Grammys were calling with an offer to play in the 2020 awards show. Ms. Calley shimmers in a glittering gold evening gown as she initiates the orchestral opening for the Colombian singer-songwriter Karol G's performance of "Tusa," which was nominated for Song of the Year.Ms. Calley also appeared onstage for the rapper Roddy Ricch's musical performance of "Heartless" on Sunday's 63rd annual Grammy Awards broadcast. "A lot of interesting and amazing opportunities have come from social media," Ms. Calley said. She has taken on a small group of students — all women of color — hoping to instill enthusiasm for the harp.If social media has made the harp more approachable to music fans, then advances in production that make the instrument more portable — and affordable — have also lowered the barriers to entry for beginning players.One such purveyor of budget-friendly harps is Backyard Music in Willimantic, Conn., owned by David Magnuson. The Fireside Folk Harp, which costs $169 and can be shipped ready made or as a D.I.Y. kit, has become a popular choice among harp hobbyists and beginner musicians.Mr. Magnuson said he began to notice a shift in harp sales within the last few years, a trend that accelerated with the onset of the pandemic. Last year alone, he said, his Etsy store sold some 300 harps. "It was shocking to me," Mr. Magnuson said. "It has really picked up and hasn't slowed down at all."Antonio Arosemena, 35, is one of Backyard Music's customers. Mr. Arosemena, who teaches music at the East Ramapo School District in New York, needed an affordable practice instrument he could use with his 6-year-old son, Luca.As a toddler, the young boy gravitated toward his father's harpsichord — but he wasn't interested in touching the keyboard. He wanted to get at the strings underneath the hood."He was looking inside the instrument more and wanted to touch the strings," Mr. Arosemena said. "I was like, 'If you want to touch the strings, we're going to get you an instrument where you can touch all the strings that you want.'"His search for a suitable starter harp initially led him to a manufacturer in Pakistan. But as his son's playing progressed, Mr. Arosemena realized he needed something more portable that he could bring with him on road trips to keep up his practice routine.So Mr. Arosemena ordered the Fireside harp kit. He documented the entire process on Instagram and said it took him only a few days to build the three-piece hardwood kit; the most difficult part was installing the 22 strings. "That went from being my instrument to help him with rhythm to being his practice instrument," he said.A recent Instagram post shows Luca, who started kindergarten last fall, dutifully reading sheet music as he practices arpeggios on the harp from the comfort of his living room couch. As he cleanly plucks the last note, he turns toward the camera and shyly reveals a smile, celebrating his musical triumph.

Caroline Gholson had often told Andrew Fallon that she wanted him to propose over coffee — in bed."Coffee in bed is our Sunday morning ritual," said Ms. Gholson, 37, the senior recruiting and development manager in Houston for the law firm Kirkland & Ellis."The concept of a public proposal," she said, "mortifies me."She left the rest up to Mr. Fallon, 36, a former executive recruiter in Houston with whom Ms. Gholson shares another ritual: pranking, as in playing practical jokes on each other, like the one she played on him five years ago at a spa in Lake Geneva, Wis."I told Andrew that everyone at that particular spa swims in the nude," Ms. Gholson said. "We went to our respective locker rooms and I changed into my bathing suit, then Andrew walked over to the pool, completely naked, under a white robe.""Once he realized that no one else was naked, he gave me a look as if to say 'You got me,' " she said, "and then he scooted back inside the locker room."In November 2015, while both were living in Chicago, Ms. Gholson and Mr. Fallon came together, fittingly, by taking swipes at each other on Tinder. Ms. Gholson, who previously lived in New York for several years, had been in Chicago only five months when her playful rival emerged.A few days after meeting online, they went on a first date, their night beginning with Mr. Fallon telling Ms. Gholson that a man wearing a trench coat and sitting behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, was his personal driver, — the man was actually an Uber driver whom Mr. Fallon had never met before — which had Ms. Gholson saying to herself, "I guess this Andrew guy is rich."The driver, whom Mr. Fallon called "Donald," whisked the couple away to a restaurant, and by the time the check came, Ms. Gholson and Mr. Fallon, ever the recruiters, had found in each other the prankster they had long been searching for."I've known Caroline for many years after working together at a law firm in New York — a city where dating is no easy feat," said Brianna Rose, a friend of Ms. Gholson's. "When she moved to Chicago and met Andrew within a few months, I sensed he was different. His playful, lighthearted nature was the perfect balance that she had been searching for."Indeed, Ms. Gholson saw Mr. Fallon again, and again and again, and it wasn't long before they began cooking up shenanigans in the most unexpected places, and at the most unexpected times."A few months later, when we started tossing around the L-word, I asked Andrew what he loved most about me," Ms. Gholson recalled. "He said, 'you have the most awesome sense of humor and you are not offended at all by my off-color jokes.'"Nor was Mr. Fallon offended by the way that first date shook out, ending with a quick hug, nary a word spoken, and Ms. Gholson, four blocks from her apartment, staging a bizarre stunt of her own: She refused to be walked home by Mr. Fallon."I liked him so much after that first date, I was at a loss for words," said Ms. Gholson. "Instead of talking to him, I decided to jog home."After spending New Year's Eve 2015 together, the couple decided to commit, which meant it was almost time to start meeting each other's families.Mr. Fallon did just that in July 2016, inviting Ms. Gholson to Pittsburgh to meet his entire family at his grandmother's 90th birthday party.When someone at that party asked how Mr. Fallon and Ms. Gholson met, Mr. Fallon's mother turned to her future daughter-in-law and said, "Yes, tell us about how he spotted you across the room at a bar that first night."Ms. Gholson was perplexed."Oh no," she said. "We met on Tinder.'Now Mr. Fallon's 90-year-old grandmother was perplexed."What is a Tinder?" she asked.Their conversation was soon skidding off the rails."You know," Ms. Gholson remembered his mother saying, "he had to push past all those other girls, left and right, until he spotted Caroline across the bar."Ms. Gholson soon realized that Mr. Fallon's mother was telling a story that she could have only heard from Mr. Fallon, whom Ms. Gholson noticed at that precise moment was now sneaking out of the room."He got me again," Ms. Gholson said to herself.[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]Ms. Gholson, who graduated from Southern Methodist University and received a master's degree in learning and organizational change from Northwestern University, where she was a Fulbright scholar, and Mr. Fallon, who graduated from Miami of Ohio and received an M.B.A. from DePaul, could only take educated guesses as to when the other might strike next with a well thought out, perfectly timed prank."Some pranks are instantaneous," Mr. Fallon said, "while certain others, like how I finally proposed to Caroline, play out over time."Mr. Fallon was referring to the day he became engaged to Ms. Gholson, on Aug. 30, 2020.That day began with Ms. Gholson and Mr. Fallon visiting an open house in their Houston neighborhood. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Fallon and Ms. Gholson to take a walk with him in a local park, 15 minutes from their home in the Houston Heights area.After rounding a corner of the park, the couple found themselves in a large, grassy area, from which Ms. Gholson said she could see "what looked like a bedroom."Mr. Fallon suggested that they investigate, and they soon found an air mattress with sheets, a blanket, and pillow, along with a night stand complete with a potted succulent plant.And then Ms. Gholson noticed, right there on the night stand, two cups of coffee, one labeled with an "A" and the other with a "C," and when she saw Mr. Fallon reach for them, she shrieked, "It's just a coincidence, don't touch that person's coffee!"Mr. Fallon then reached for Ms. Gholson's hands and told her that the bedroom in the park was no aberration, nor did it belong to anyone else."You always said you wanted this to happen, to be proposed to over coffee in bed," he said. "But I wanted to give you a grand gesture, so I split the difference and brought our bedroom here to Memorial Park."He got her again — this time forever."You're my person and I love you," he added. "Will you marry me?"Family members who had helped set up the bedroom scene and friends in secret attendance began running from hiding spots to congratulate the couple."I was speechless," Ms. Gholson said. "But I managed at some point to say yes."They were married March 6 at the Commodore Perry Estate in Austin, Texas.Lt. Col. Charles A. Fallon, the groom's brother who became an American Marriage minister for the occasion, officiated.When the bride was asked if she and her new husband had any immediate plans, she said:"Oh, I have a few things planned that Andrew knows nothing about.

In early January, Nicole Brienza, a recent nursing school graduate, was looking for work. When she found out about the huge vaccination program that was about to open at the Javits Center, she applied immediately. "Within an hour I got a call," she said. Three days later she was offered a position there. "This job makes me feel like I'm part of history," said Ms. Brienza, 24, whose first day at Javits was Jan. 17. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience." She lives with her parents, Carmela and Joe Brienza, and her younger brothers, Joey and Johnny, in Whitestone, Queens.UP AND OUT If I work out, I get up at 4:30 or 5. During Covid, my father turned our basement into a gym. I'll do a Peloton workout. If I skip that, I'm up at 5:45. I make Starbuck's Morning Brew, shower and dress, eat a granola bar or have some oatmeal and leave by 6:10. The 7 train doesn't really run at the Flushing stop on Sunday, which I sometimes take during the week, so my mother drives me to work.ENTRY I have my mask on by the time I walk through the entrance. Soldiers make sure we enter six feet apart. Our temperature is checked, and I'm asked the same questions every day: Do I feel sick, have I been to any states where I need to quarantine? I scan my ID, then I put my belongings and my lunch in a locker and take out my goggles.SET UP I get a face shield, fresh mask and a box of gloves and go to a table. I'm one of approximately 130 nurses at 58 tables. I like the ones in the front best because you do more vaccinations. It takes people longer to walk to the back tables. I sanitize the table and make sure there are boxes of alcohol wipes and Band-Aids. Someone brings us the vaccines. We get six syringes at a time, one injection per person. These have been prepared by the pharmacists, who are also on the floor with us. If it's a really busy day, they will put two nurses at a table, but usually it's just me and the data entry person.JABS I inject 100 to 150 people a day with the Pfizer vaccine. Sundays are the busiest. I spend five to 10 minutes with each person. Everyone is happy, grateful and appreciative. Everyone has thanked me; some have cried. In the morning, they all say how surprised they are that the line moved so fast and wished the airport moved as quickly. When I started doing this, I was nervous and the conversation was more of a script. Now it flows naturally. I introduce myself, try to lighten the mood, ask how they are, how was it coming into the city and try to help them relax. Then I dive deeper — do they have allergies; if they do, what are their reactions? If they are on their second vaccine I ask how their symptoms were; if it's their first I tell them what their symptoms might be.COFFEE BREAK I do my first 15-minute break at 9:30. Javits offers meals if we want them. They also have snacks like bananas, rice cakes, granola bars, tea, coffee and water bottles. It takes two minutes to walk to the cafeteria area downstairs and two minutes back so I'll sit and have a coffee. Most people are not energetic at this hour. They're on their phones and it's a relaxed vibe.NEW CROWD From 9:45 to 11:30, older people start to come. They get their own line so they don't have to wait, and they come to the first few rows of tables. I always feel comfortable with them, though I'm afraid of hurting them because they don't have as much muscle. A lot of people say I'm a pro. Or I have a soft touch. That they didn't feel the needle. As a new grad, that feels good. Middle-aged people tend to cry more because it's emotional for them. QUIET LUNCH I'm at the locker area at 11:30 and get my homemade lunch: a salad or falafel wrap. I heard good things about the Javits food, but I like to know what ingredients are in something I'm eating. I've made friends with a lot of people already; some are new grads, some are retired nurses coming back to help. Everyone is friendly. During this time I try to stay quiet and to relax.BACKUP Noon to 3:30 is more of the same. It's busier; the line is building up. People dressed in red vests are called "runners." They're Army people who go from the pharmacy to pick up the syringes and drop them off at our tables. They do checks constantly. If we are down to two doses we hang a green laminated sheet on a lamp, which is what we turn on when we're ready for the next patient. You can see the green from far away. If I'm low on gloves, someone is always there to get me supplies. If I need to use the restroom, someone will cover me.TIME OUT At 3:30, I take another break. I might use the restroom or grab a bottle of water from the break room on the main floor. It saves me the time of going downstairs and coming back up. I'm starting to get tired. I'll sit in a chair, check my phone, answer texts and look at Instagram.AFTERNOON RUSH 3:45 to 5 is our busiest time. The line has backed up. People have come later than their appointment time. I haven't had anyone who isn't supposed to be here, but a lot of people ask if I can get their spouse an appointment. I feel bad because I can't. They all know it's a "no," but they ask to see if they get lucky.THE WAIT LIST Out of nowhere it gets slow from 5 to 6:30. The pharmacists are trying to figure out how many syringes they will need. They don't want to draw up extra, and you only have a six-hour window to use them. If we have extras we call people who are on a wait list to see if they can come down. Those people I give shots to are the most excited because they didn't expect it. They've dropped everything to be here.COUNTRY MUSIC COMMUTE At 7, I clean up, organize and sanitize the table. I meet so many different people I'm mentally and physically exhausted. My body hurts. I clock out and exit the building the same way I came in. The air is refreshing. I haven't had any all day. I enjoy the work, but I've been on my feet for 12 hours. My mother has parked in the front and is waiting for me. She loves to talk, but I'm talked out so we turn on the radio and listen to country music.TOO TIRED I'm home by 8. I'm starving at this point. My mother has cooked dinner, and I'm so grateful. I shower and do my face routine. I fall into bed around 9:30. I might watch some Netflix. I just finished "Bridgerton." Lately I've been too tired to do anything else. My friends feel they haven't seen me. They don't understand I'm working 12-hour days.

Should you drink coffee? If so, how much? These seem like questions that a society able to create vaccines for a new respiratory virus within a year should have no trouble answering. And yet the scientific literature on coffee illustrates a frustration that readers, not to mention plenty of researchers, have with nutrition studies: The conclusions are always changing, and they frequently contradict one another. This sort of disagreement might not matter so much if we're talking about foods or drinks that aren't widely consumed. But in 1991, when the World Health Organization classified coffee as a possible carcinogen, the implications were enormous: More than half of the American population drinks coffee daily. A possible link between the beverage and bladder and pancreatic cancers had been uncovered by observational studies. But it would turn out that such studies — in which researchers ask large numbers of people to report information about things like their dietary intake and daily habits and then look for associations with particular health outcomes — hadn't recognized that those who smoke are more likely to drink coffee. It was the smoking that increased their cancer risk; once that association (along with others) was understood, coffee was removed from the list of carcinogens in 2016. The next year, a review of the available evidence, published in The British Medical Journal, found a link between coffee and a lower risk for some cancers, as well as for cardiovascular disease and death from any cause.Now a new analysis of existing data, published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure, suggests that two to three (or more) cups of coffee per day may lower the risk of heart failure. Of course, the usual caveats apply: This is association, not causation. It could be that people with heart disease tend to avoid coffee, possibly thinking it will be bad for them. So ... good for you or not good for you, which is it? And if we can't ever tell, what's the point of these studies?Critics have argued, in fact, that there isn't one — that nutrition research should shift its focus away from observational studies to randomized control trials. By randomly giving coffee to one group and withholding it from another, such trials can try to tease apart cause and effect. Yet when it comes to understanding how any aspect of our diet affects our health, both approaches have significant limitations. Our diets work on us over a lifetime; it's not feasible to keep people in a lab, monitoring their coffee intake, until they develop heart failure. But it's notoriously difficult to get people to accurately report what they eat and drink at home. Ideally, to get to the bottom of the coffee question, you would know the type of coffee bean used and how it was roasted, ground and brewed — all of which affect its biochemistry — plus the exact amount ingested, its temperature and the amount and type of any added sweetener or dairy. Then you would consider all the other variables that influence a coffee drinker's metabolism and overall health: genome, microbiome, lifestyle (sleep habits, for example) and socioeconomic status (is there household stress? poor local air quality?). Randomized control trials could still yield useful insights into how coffee influences biological processes over shorter periods. This might help explain, and thus validate, certain longer-term associations. But before doing a trial on a given nutrient, scientists need to have some reason for thinking that it might have a meaningful impact on lots of people; they also need to already have plausible evidence that testing the compound on human subjects won't do them lasting harm.The Circulation study employed observational data, but its initial aim was not to assess the relationship between coffee and heart failure. This is how the lead author David Kao, a cardiologist at University of Colorado School of Medicine, characterized it to me: "The overall question was, What are the factors in daily life that impact heart health that we don't know about that could potentially be changed to lower risk." Because one in five Americans will develop heart failure, even small changes in their behaviors could have a big cumulative impact. Traditionally, researchers start out with a hypothesis — coffee lowers the risk of heart disease, for example. Then they compare subjects' coffee intake with their cardiovascular history. One drawback to this process is that there are all sorts of ways researchers' preconceived notions can lead them to find false relationships by influencing which variables they include and exclude in the analysis or by prompting unscrupulous researchers to manipulate the data to fit their theory. "You can dredge up any finding you want in science using your own biases, and you get a publication out of it," says Steven Heymsfield, a professor of metabolism and body composition at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. To illustrate this point, a widely cited 2013 review in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition searched for 50 common cookbook ingredients in the scientific literature; 36 had been linked individually to an increased or decreased risk of cancer, including celery and peas.Kao, however, didn't start with a hypothesis. Instead, he used a powerful and increasingly popular data-analysis technique known as machine learning to look for links between thousands of patient characteristics collected in the well-known Framingham Heart Study and the odds of those patients' developing heart failure. The algorithm "will start to line up the variables that contributed the most to the variance in the data," or the range of cardiac outcomes, says Diana Thomas, a professor of mathematics at West Point. "And that's objective." The ability of machine learning to process vast amounts of data could transform the ability of nutrition researchers to study their subjects' behavior more precisely and in real time, says Amanda Vest, medical director of the Cardiac Transplantation Program at Tufts Medical Center, who wrote an editorial that was published with the Circulation study. For example, it could be trained to scan photographs of subjects' meals and interpret their macronutrient level. It could also analyze data from geolocation devices, activity sensors and social media. But machine learning is only as good as the data being analyzed. Without careful controls, says Michael Kosorok, a professor of biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "it gives us the ability to make more and more mistakes." If, for instance, it is applied to data sets that aren't diverse or random enough, the patterns it sees won't hold up when the algorithm then uses them to make real-world predictions. This has been a serious problem with facial-recognition software: Trained primarily on white male subjects, the algorithms have been much less accurate in identifying women and people of color. Algorithms must also be programmed to handle uncertainty in the data — as when one person's reported "cup of coffee" is six ounces and another's is eight ounces. An analysis like Kao's, which starts with no preconceived notions about what the data might say, can reveal connections no one has thought of. But those findings must be rigorously tested to see if they can be replicated in other contexts. After the link appeared between coffee intake and a reduced risk of heart failure in the Framingham data, Kao confirmed the result by using the algorithm to correctly predict the relationship between coffee intake and heart failure in two other respected data sets. Kosorok describes the approach as "thoughtful" and says that it "seems like pretty good evidence." Still, it's not definitive. Rather, it's part of a growing body of evidence that, at the moment, can say little about how much coffee people should drink. "It may be good for you," says Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. "I think we can say with good certainty it's not bad for you." (Additives are another story.) Getting more specific will require more research. Last year, Mozaffarian and others called on the National Institutes of Health to establish an institute for nutrition science that could coordinate those efforts and, crucially, help people interpret the results. "We need a well-funded, well-organized, coordinated effort to figure out nutrition," he says. "No single study gets to the truth."Kim Tingley is a contributing writer for the magazine.

Intensely green, verging on chartreuse, plantains hang like chandeliers from tall broad-leafed plants across the Caribbean. The botanical name is Musa paradisiaca, the second word meaning "of paradise."The plátano is generous, and can be eaten in all stages of ripeness. In Puerto Rico, the greenest ones can be fried, smashed and blended with garlic, olive oil and chicharrones — pork cracklins — to make mofongo, one of the island's best-known dishes. When their peels turn bright yellow, speckled with dark spots, plátanos can be fried and served alongside rice and beans for that signature agridulce flavor, sweet and salty. And when they finally become black and squishy, seemingly past their prime, their flesh can be boiled, then blended with butter, and then pressed into a pan to make pastelón, a casserole layered with sofrito-laced beef.I was born in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, but raised in the suburbs outside Atlanta. My family traveled back to Puerto Rico often — not always the case for those of us on the U.S. mainland — and I was fascinated by those plantain chandeliers. I lived in two worlds in my mind: a lush, loud, exciting tropical wonderland, and a seemingly cultureless, strip mall-laden labyrinth of subdivisions.The island beckoned me. I longed for the feeling of hot, tropical air hitting my face as I exited the plane, for the interlaced smells of garlicky grilled meat and car exhaust, for the sonorous canopy of El Yunque rainforest.I love Puerto Rico deeply. It's where my heart lives, where my mind wanders at night when I can't sleep. But we don't always love the places we're from. My mother, in fact, hasn't been back to the island in 11 years. For her, Puerto Rico is chaos, rife with machismo, economic instability, crumbling infrastructure and bad memories. Despite the fact that Puerto Rico is part of the United States, those on the island have long struggled with inequities that can make life there extremely difficult.And yet, my soul dwells there.The Times asked me to write about some of Puerto Rico's essential dishes, to choose and share 10 that both resonate with me and reflect the island's people. It's challenging, even audacious, to distill a cuisine to any number of recipes, and, because of Puerto Rico's complex colonial history, it's particularly difficult to describe its food in simple terms. And so I chose to look closely at dishes that express the innate hybridity of the culture, and celebrate the foundational techniques and ingredients that make its food so compelling, and satisfying.The cuisine is a culinary mejunje, or mix, of Indigenous, African, Spanish and American ingredients and techniques. In "Eating Puerto Rico," the food historian Cruz Miguel Ortíz explores how Indigenous herbs and root vegetables; African plantains and coconuts; Spanish olive oil, pork and tomatoes; and American canned foods form the mestizo or Creole cuisine exemplified on the island. And the culinary bricolage of the island continues to expand as a younger generation of farmers and chefs insist on modernizing the cuisine."Porque es vivo," Mr. Ortiz said. "Y simple." The cuisine is alive, in flux, he said, yet simple and intensely flavored. Its foundation is sofrito — a blend of garlic, onions, peppers, and recao or culantro (cilantro's earthy cousin, which thrives on the island). Even in the darkest times, the smell of sofrito sizzling in olive oil is a balm; blended with tomato sauce and rice, its flavor conjures comfort.Sofrito, for me, is essential. But what is "essential" is subjective, so I believe it's about what fulfills a need. For some of us, that need is nostalgia. A dish may be essential because it fills your heart with joyful memories, of smells and flavors, of your grandmother loudly playing Juan Luis Guerra, teaching you to dance, her hair still in rollers. For others, essential might mean nourishing to the body, or a meal that fills you ahead of a long day of work.The dishes below are essential to me because of the stories they tell, the ways they embody my people's strength and creativity, and how cooking them has helped me make sense of the brutality of my island. As Jessica B. Harris wrote of African enslavement in her 2011 book "High on the Hog": "It must be looked at in all its horror and degradation, complicity and confusion, for it tells us where and what we have come from."I am a journalist, oral historian and professor of food studies in North Carolina, and, in these roles, I look closely at the global scale of imperialism, and investigate similarities among island cultures. The more I study the impact of colonization on bodies and ecosystems, the tremendous violence that occurs when monoculture replaces biodiversity, when enslavers replace Indigenous cultures and cosmologies with their own, the paradox of loving a place as difficult and complex as Puerto Rico becomes clearer. Because while much has been done to subjugate and disrupt Puerto Rico, its spirit remains.These recipes tell the story of that spirit — of an Indigenous Taíno population believed to have been exterminated, but still living in the mitochondrial DNA of thousands of Puerto Ricans. You see that story in dishes like yuca con mojo, a humble celebration of the root vegetable that was once the cornerstone of the Taíno diet.They describe fortitude and la brega, a term often used by Puerto Ricans to describe improvising, hustling and making do. Sancocho, its name synonymous with a mix of whatever ingredients are available, is a stew brimming with classic island flavors: yuca, yautia (taro), plantains, often pumpkin. Arroz mamposteao — just one of the many ways rice and beans are prepared — is scrappy, making magic of leftovers.They are stories of creativity and tradition, blending colonial ingredients with ancestral cooking techniques. Take pernil, the coveted garlic-and-herb-marinated pork shoulder that is traditionally slow-roasted whole over coals. On the island, there's an entire stretch of highway through densely forested Guavate — La Ruta del Lechón — dedicated to pork made with precision by families committed to the craft.These dishes celebrate the contributions of the tens of thousands of Africans taken to the island in bondage, who introduced processes like deep frying, among many other things, and who are credited with cultivating rice, the cornerstone of the Puerto Rican diet to this day. Fritters such as alcapurrias de jueyes — a blend of green banana and yautia, stuffed with delicate crab — hark back to Loíza, a town on the northeastern coast with rich African ancestry.And then there are completely modern dishes that reference what has always grown on the island. In pastelillos de guayaba, guava — the epitome of tropical flavor — is balanced by crumbly, salty queso en hoja, fresh cheese, which is baked into a beignet and delightfully dusted with powdered sugar. Nothing ancestral here; it's just extremely delicious, and makes use of the island's bounty of fruit.Above all, these dishes exemplify a deeply creative people, who make food that is flavorful and soul-nourishing.What I want to suggest here is that, instead of holding European foods and cooking techniques as the highest standards, we look to the cuisines of islands, of places that have struggled, to gain inspiration from how they managed to make things taste so good against all odds. This is old, deep knowledge, and we can all learn from it, regardless of background, and find ways to integrate this way of thinking into the way we cook.And to keep culinary cultures vibrant, we must adapt. For the past 15 years, the Puerto Rican diaspora has outnumbered the population on the island, and many of us have been forced to recreate our favorite dishes using very different ingredients and tools. I might need to use a bell pepper instead of ají dulce, or paprika instead of annatto. But as I say in the introduction to "Coconuts and Collards," my first book, "It's Puerto Rican because I made it." These microadjustments ensure that I can still keep the flavors of my homeland in my mouth.Many of my fellow Puerto Ricans may see this list and exclaim: "What about bacalao?" "What about tostones?" Or plátanos maduros, or coquito. There are so many things. I humbly offer these recipes in the spirit of sharing what for me is like mother's milk, the flavors from which my palate was born — sofrito in the womb, a lifeline to the island.As you explore and prepare these recipes, I encourage you to consider the blends of flavors. That combination of yautia and green banana with the sofrito and crab in alcapurrias is unmistakably earthy and robust, salty crispness balanced by delicate seafood. The richness of the chicken thighs in pollo en fricasé, simmered in tangy tomato and white wine, punctuated by briny olives, immediately conjures Mami's kitchen for many Puerto Ricans, just as the smell of pernil roasting in the oven transports us to every family Christmas and Thanksgiving we ever attended.You may notice there aren't many vegetables in this collection. That is not a reflection of how most Puerto Ricans eat today. On my last trip to the island, just as Covid-19 was setting in, I ate whole ají dulce peppers, flash-fried tempura style, at the chef Natalia Vallejo's restaurant Cocina al Fondo, which will soon reopen. At Vianda, I had locally sourced radishes with grapefruit and XO sauce. At Bacoa Finca + Fogón, I was enthralled by a spread made from local beets.But growing up, and in the cafeteria-style Puerto Rican joints I've frequented here on the mainland, the most common vegetable accompaniment to our food is a simple side salad. Oftentimes it's forgettable: limp iceberg lettuce with tomatoes, canned green beans or peas, dressed with olive oil and vinegar. But salads are the perfect pairing for Puerto Rican dishes — they balance the richness with roughage — so I often pair these recipes with a simple salad of mixed greens, avocado, tomatoes and hearts of palm in a cilantro vinaigrette.The dishes I present here were foundational to my understanding of flavor, and everything I cook springs from them. In my conversations with fellow Boricuas of all ages and walks of life, both here and on the island, these were all mentioned. Above all, I love each one of these dishes, and I hope you will enjoy making them too.Von's Essential RecipesYuca con MojoYuca is among the most commonly eaten viandas — the local word for starchy fruits and vegetables, such as plantain and taro — in Puerto Rico. It is the root of the cassava, an extraordinarily resilient plant that was the principal food of the Indigenous Taínos of the island. Among its many preparations, this is my favorite: boiled yuca doused in a garlicky citrus mojo dressing, my grandmother's recipe. She never wrote it down, but my mother had it deep in her memory, and we cooked it together for this version you see here. The mojo will keep for several weeks in the fridge, and is also delicious on crispy fried tostones, roasted vegetables and fish. (View this recipe.)Pollo en FricaséThe ultimate comfort food, this dish bears the mark of Spanish and French colonial influence, but takes a decidedly Puerto Rican approach. Bone-in chicken thighs are braised to perfection in a rich, oniony, tomato-based sauce with a lot of garlic, balanced with white wine and vinegar, and punctuated by briny olives and capers. Potatoes are added toward the end, for a satisfying meal. Like so many Puerto Rican dishes, this one is highly adaptable. My take is pared down and incredibly simple, making it an easy weeknight meal that can be prepared while you're getting your house in order after work. This recipe is adapted from "Cocina Criolla," which has remained the island's most popular cookbook for more than 60 years. (View this recipe.)SancochoSancocho, a word often used as slang by Puerto Ricans to mean a big old mix of things, is a rustic stew eaten across the Caribbean and made with every imaginable combination of proteins and vegetables. My father cooked his with beef, corn and noodles; my mom with chicken breasts, lean pork and sweet plantains; my grandmother with beef, pork on the bone and yautia. As such, I've rarely used a recipe, so this one is based largely on observation, taste memory and what I like. Pretty much every ingredient can be swapped out, and, without meat, it also makes for a robust vegetarian dish. Sancocho epitomizes the resilience of Puerto Rican people, as it is often prepared in times of crisis — such as after a hurricane — and made with whatever you have on hand. (View this recipe.)PernilPerhaps the best-known and most coveted dish from Puerto Rico, pernil is a positively sumptuous preparation for pork shoulder. It's marinated in garlic, citrus and herbs, then slow-roasted on high heat to achieve a crisp chicharrón, or skin. Traditionally, it's prepared for Thanksgiving or Christmas, but, for those of us in the diaspora, it's often made for special occasions. This recipe is indebted to the chef Maricel Presilla and her recipe in "Gran Cocina Latina," her cookbook published in 2012. Her method is a foolproof way to get that chicharrón as well as tender meat that falls off the bone. It's blessed by her brilliance. (View this recipe.)Pescado FritoFishing is an extraordinarily complex issue in Puerto Rico. Much of the seafood eaten doesn't come from the island's own waters, in part because of arcane legislation that controls fishing rights. And yet, whole deep-fried fish is a staple on the island, particularly along the west and southwest coast. There, you'll find red snapper, simply marinated in adobo, fried and served with tostones, avocado salad and white rice. It is, in my opinion, the absolute best way to enjoy a whole fish. The frying turns the head and the tail into a crunchy fish chicharrón, and the skin and flesh cook evenly, keeping the flesh moist and the skin crisp. While bones are often a concern for those uncomfortable eating whole fish, there's a simple solution: Eat it with your hands. Your fingers will do a much better job of finding bones than your fork will, and the experience is more visceral, and delicious. (View this recipe.)Gandules con Bolitas de PlátanoGood cooks need good eaters, and preparing food for people I care about brings me tremendous joy. This dish is among those I've shared with others, and one that I share here in honor of my dear friend Liyna Anwar, who died a year ago. We were colleagues, and, because she was Muslim and ate strictly halal, I often brought her vegetarian dishes to sample. This was among her favorites. Green plantains are finely grated, mixed with simple spices, formed into balls with a spoon, and then dunked directly into simmering pigeon peas; the natural starch of the plantains sets up without added flour. Liyna once prepared this dish alongside me, delighting in the experience of forming the buoyant dumplings. The memory of her happiness blends now with my own memories of eating it. (View this recipe.)Carne GuisadaAmong the most recognizable dishes of my culture, carne guisada will cure what ails you. Beef is slowly braised with aromatic sofrito and tomatoes, producing an incredibly rich dish you're likely to eat too much of. For those who have lived in Puerto Rican enclaves in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago or Orlando, Fla., this is a daily staple at cafeteria-style lunch counters, as it is on the island. You can also use this recipe to make pollo guisado, equally popular and common, simply by using chicken and adjusting the cooking time accordingly. (View this recipe.)Arroz MamposteaoRice and beans are religion in Puerto Rico, though they're typically prepared separately but served together, several spoonfuls of beans on top of white rice. But mamposteao — easily my favorite name for a Puerto Rican dish — combines the two. It's a preparation intended to make use of leftovers, as it benefits from day-old rice and prepared beans. Traditionally, pork and tomato sauce are added — but, for a more subtle approach to this recipe, bacon fat replaces ham or tocino (fatback) here, giving the dish a smoky richness without any meat. You can prepare this dish from start to finish with fresh rice and fresh beans, but it's not recommended. (View this recipe.)Alcapurrias de JueyesPuerto Rico is famous for its fritters, and alcapurrias are among the most desired. Imagine a tamale made of green banana and root vegetable masa that is stuffed with savory meat or seafood, and then deep fried. You typically get them from the kioskos, roadside stands along Puerto Rico's beaches and highways, particularly in Loíza, a town on the northeastern coast that is the island's African heart. At home, they're often made over the holidays, as many hands make light work. The flavor is unmistakable: earthy green banana and taro cut by savory sofrito, briny capers and delicate crab meat. This recipe is adapted from one by María Dolores "Lula" de Jesús, the 84-year-old owner of El Burén de Lula in Loíza, who is considered by many to be a madrina, or godmother, of this and other dishes with African origins. (View this recipe.)Pastelillos de GuayabaPanaderías in Puerto Rico are magical. Their brightly lit glass cases are lined with fresh-baked bread and rich pastries, begging you to order too many. As a child, I clamored for pastelillos (also called pastelitos) de guayaba. The pastries typically have a flaky crust and are filled with a generous smear of concentrated guava paste — an embodiment of tropical Caribbean flavor — and often with cheese, served glazed or dusted with powdered sugar. In East Harlem, or El Barrio, New York's historic Puerto Rican enclave where I lived for some time, I discovered Valencia Bakery on East 103rd Street, which made a bite-size version with a generous amount of confectioners' sugar, creating a portal between the island and my new home. My recipe is inspired by theirs. (View this recipe.)SofritoSofrito — a blend of garlic, onions, peppers and recao (culantro) — is the backbone of Puerto Rican flavor. Also referred to as recaito, it's typically sautéed in oil as the foundation for sauces, braises, beans, stews and rice dishes, including many of the recipes above.My grandmother often kept sofrito in the freezer stored in a repurposed plastic margarine container, or frozen into cubes and saved in plastic zip-top bags.(View this recipe.)SazónCumin-heavy sazón is among the most commonly used spice blends in Puerto Rican cooking, and is also popular throughout Latin America.Commercial brands are flavor bombs pumped with monosodium glutamate — MSG — that can make almost anything taste better. While I'm not MSG-phobic, I do prefer making my own blends to control both the flavor and the salt content. This is my take on sazón, minus the MSG, and with turmeric added along with the standard annatto to imbue dishes with a golden hue.

In a corner of Gherardo Felloni's Paris apartment is a 19th-century marble bust of Apollo that rests on a candy pink block of cement by Duccio Maria Gambi, a contemporary furniture and interior designer based in Florence. The juxtaposition amuses Felloni, who is the creative director of the famed French shoe and accessories label Roger Vivier, and encapsulates his aesthetic. "I am really attracted by contrasts," says the 41-year-old. "Even in my personal life, I like to wear a white Brooks Brothers shirt, or an H&M T-shirt, with antique jewels."The creation that resulted from his crack at the "Make T Something" challenge, for which participants have one hour to create an object using a copy of The New York Times, a selection of craft supplies and a wild-card item of their choosing, is a case in point: A high-heeled shoe expertly fashioned out of newsprint, it sports a pointed toe encrusted with a crystal buckle, a Vivier signature. "I liked the mix of a recycled newspaper, something you read every day, combined with crystals that look like diamonds — a precious touch," says Felloni, who is an avid collector of antique parures.Felloni comes from a line of Italian shoemakers. He grew up in the Arezzo region of Tuscany, assisting at a family-owned factory, founded by his uncle, that manufactured shoes for brands including Hermès and Gucci. Naturally, he was tempted to rebel. "Every day of my life! One day I wanted to be an actor, then a singer, then an architect," he says. "For me, shoes were easy, in my comfort zone." He spent six years studying opera at a conservatory in Paris, and has designed interior schemes for friends in Italy, but he eventually realized shoes were in fact more than easy — they were his calling. After stints in the accessories departments at Miu Miu and John Galliano's Christian Dior, he took over from Bruno Frisoni at Roger Vivier in 2018. "Today," he says, "I do many things. There are business meetings, lots of logistics, but every time I'm in my office and I draw shoes, I feel happy." Besides, he still sings "Una Furtiva Lagrima," from the Italian opera "L'elisir d'Amore" (1832) by Gaetano Donizetti, in the shower, and spends his downtime working on the renovation of the Faro delle Vaccarecce lighthouse, which dates to 1830 and which he bought in 2015, on Tuscany's Isola del Giglio.Under his stewardship, Vivier has diverged from the classic styles, such as the Belle Vivier, a dainty court shoe made famous by Catherine Deneuve in the 1967 film "Belle de Jour," for which it is well known. Crystal-embellished sneakers and lug-soled hiking shoes now comprise the collections just as much as satin hotel slippers and grosgrain kitten heels frosted with rhinestones do. That's not to say that Felloni disregards history, though. The first thing he did when he arrived at the house was spend 15 days immersed in its archive. He already owned a rare pair of Roger Vivier PVC shoes embroidered with mother-of-pearl, secured at auction, but holding an original Belle Vivier in his hands gave him goose bumps. "It sounds banal, but it was amazing," he says.And, with his cinematic Paris Fashion Week presentations, he has restored a sense of pomp to the label. His latest, which debuts today and takes the form of a film that he wrote himself, is about five legendary actresses and certified Vivier fans — Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe and Édith Piaf — who are invited to a fashion show that is late to start, leaving them to improvise. Its biggest star, however, may be a sexy, shiny black leather boot with a nearly five-inch heel. "My job as a designer is to give hope, to give dreams," says Felloni, who adds, "at the end of filming, everybody hated me. I am very demanding. Film has a different time frame — you could spend two years working on a movie, whereas with a fashion campaign you have one month — but then it came together and the result is special, like with the newspaper shoe."

One of the great shaggy-dog mysteries of the sky continues to mesmerize astronomers. That would be the nature of a strange interloper, Oumuamua, that came zooming through the solar system in 2017. Interstellar comet? Cosmic iceberg? Alien space wreck?This week two astronomers from Arizona State University, Alan Jackson and Steven Desch, offered the most solid explanation yet: Oumuamua was a chip off a faraway planet belonging to another star. Long ago, a collision with an asteroid broke it off and sent it careering through space."This research is exciting in that we've probably resolved the mystery of what Oumuamua is, and we can reasonably identify it as a chunk of an 'exo-Pluto,' a Pluto-like planet in another solar system," Dr. Desch said in a statement released by the American Geophysical Union. "Until now, we've had no way to know if other solar systems have Pluto-like planets, but now we have seen a chunk of one pass by Earth."They announced their results at a meeting of the 52nd Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference on March 17 and in a pair of papers in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.The operative words are "probably resolved." Although astronomers agree that the new model could answer some questions about the mystery flyby, many more remain in motion."What makes Oumuamua both interesting and frustrating is that none of the theories are a slam-dunk," said Gregory Laughlin, an astronomer at Yale who has studied Oumuamua.Astronomers in Hawaii, patrolling for killer asteroids and other flashes in the night with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope on Maui, first spotted this mystery object speeding away from the sun at 50 miles per second on Oct. 19, 2017. They called it Oumuamua — Hawaiian for "scout" or "messenger." But what was the message?The trajectory of the object indicated that it had come from outside the solar system and that after a brief buzz past the inner worlds of our system it was bound for deep space. By the time it was noticed, it had already passed Earth. Astronomers concluded from the variations in its brightness that it was a tumbling object, longer than it was wide.Astronomers had long thought than an orphan comet might be the first interstellar visitor to our region because comets, residing in distant clouds, are easily detached from their home stars. Oumuamua did not have a tail, however, or the gaseous cloud that forms around a comet nucleus, so it was tentatively identified as a wandering asteroid.An artist's conception of a reddish, cigar-shaped rock gained widespread circulation. Some astronomers have suggested that it could be shaped like a pancake.But when Oumuamua was on the way out of the solar system, it sped up. Comets often act this way, as they are given a kick from jets of evaporating gas on their surfaces. So perhaps it was a comet after all — but a weird one. An illustration accompanying Dr. Jackson and Dr. Desch's result shows it looking like a cracker or even a flying cow chip.The mystery deepened in 2018 with the discovery of 2I/Borisov, another interstellar interloper that behaved more like an ordinary comet.Theories and models abounded in the literature. Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard, rode onto the best-seller list earlier this year with a book, "Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth," arguing that Oumuamua was an alien space vessel of some kind, and scolding the astronomical community for not thinking more outside the box about extraterrestrial life. The object's imputed shape, he said, could be perfectly consistent with that of a light sail of the type that Dr. Loeb and his colleagues, in an ambitious project called Breakthrough Starshot, hope to send to Alpha Centauri sometime this century.But an international team of comet experts writing in Nature Astronomy in 2019 under the name of The Oumuamua ISSI Team concluded that all the data were consistent with "a purely natural origin" for Oumuamua.Last year Dr. Laughlin of Yale and his student Darryl Seligman, now at the University of Chicago, suggested that Oumuamua was a primordial iceberg of hydrogen that had formed in the dark, cold center of a molecular cloud, one of the vast assemblages of primordial gas that give rise to stars.The problem was that it was hard to explain how the hydrogen, which freezes at a temperature around 3 degrees Kelvin, barely above absolute zero, would stay frozen on the long trip from its birth to here.Inspired by the hydrogen ice idea, Dr. Jackson and Dr. Desch investigated other kinds of icebergs that might fill the bill. They finally hit on nitrogen."We've never seen any examples of hydrogen ice in nature," Dr. Desch said in an email. But when the New Horizons spacecraft went past the previously unexplored Pluto in 2015, it found a world awash in nitrogen glaciers."Oumuamua was small, about half as long as a city block and only as thick as a three-story building, but it was very shiny," they wrote in one of their papers. "The shininess is about the same as the surfaces of Pluto and Triton, which are also covered in nitrogen ice." Triton is a moon of Neptune.In the scenario favored by Dr. Desch and Dr. Jackson, the nascent Oumuamua was knocked from a Pluto-like object that was circling a distant star some half-billion years ago. It would have originally been roundish, but as it traveled through space it was carved away by cosmic rays.By the time it entered our solar system in 1995 or so, it had lost half its original mass, according to their model. During its passage around the sun it likely melted to a sliver, like a bar of soap in the shower, the researchers say. Only 10 percent would have remained by the time it left the solar system, boosted by the rocketlike effect of evaporating nitrogen.Nitrogen sublimates at about 25 degrees Kelvin, Dr. Desch said: "We calculate that Oumuamua reached temperatures in the 45 to 50 K range while it rounded the sun, so it was sublimating nitrogen gas like crazy, hence the strong mass loss."He and Dr. Jackson concluded in their paper: "A key advantage of the proposal we advance here of a nitrogen ice fragment is that it can simultaneously explain all of the important observational characteristics of Oumuamua, and that material of this composition is found in the solar system. We therefore conclude that Oumuamua is an example of an uncommon but certainly not exotic object: a fragment of a differentiated Pluto-like planet from another stellar system."Of course, that's not the end of the story.In an email Dr. Loeb complained, among other things, that if Oumuamua was made of nitrogen it should also contain carbon (which was not detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope), because both nitrogen and carbon are produced together by a thermonuclear carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle in stars.Dr. Desch responded in an email: "Spoken like a cosmologist!" He went on to note that planets have ways of sifting and separating the elements they were born with. Otherwise Earth's atmosphere, which is 79 percent nitrogen, should be several percent carbon instead of one-tenth of 1 percent carbon. Or, as another astronomer pointed out, the Great Lakes would all be full of sparkling water.Dr. Desch noted, moreover, that the reddish color of Oumuamua is an exact match to the redness of the ice on Pluto, which is 0.1 percent carbon, in the form of methane.Another issue is statistics. How is it that these cosmic icebergs are so common — more than 50 trillion per cubic light-year of space, according to a calculation by Dr. Laughlin — that the Pan-STARRS project would have discovered one after just five years of searching?"That puts a lot of pressure on the galaxy to manufacture exo-Plutos," Dr. Laughlin said.If so, Oumuamua was just the tip of an unsuspected iceberg, so to speak, which is exactly what Dr. Desch and Dr. Jackson contend.A lot of things get ejected from planetary systems, Dr. Desch pointed out; older papers assumed that these would be as big as comets, and so predicted them in much lower numbers. But if they are smaller, Dr. Desch added, there would be many more fragments flying out, so something like Oumuamua would not necessarily be an anomaly."So far we've seen one N2 ice fragment and one comet among the interstellar objects," he wrote in an email. "Small-number statistics doesn't get much smaller than that." Those numbers were about what is expected, according to their calculations, he said: "Maybe we got a little lucky to see one so quickly, but it's not a fluke or anything. This is a common object to be entering our solar system."If more are out there to be seen, they should soon be detectable by the Vera Rubin Observatory, a giant telescope in Chile that will start stalking the sky later this decade.Other astronomers have suggested a different creation mechanics, in which a distant planet passing close to its star is torn apart by tidal forces. This would result in fragments even more oblong, closer in resemblance to a cigar than a cookie, casting doubt on the nitrogen ice theory, Dr. Laughlin said. That is a controversy that could be resolved by better images, if and when the next interstellar interloper comes by.But as Dr. Laughlin said, nature might have the last laugh. "Given the rule of thumb that 99 percent of one's own cool ideas tend not to work out," he said, "I think the smart money is on another object with Oumuamua's characteristic weirdnesses never again being observed."Sync your calendar with the solar systemNever miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.Exploring the Solar SystemA guide to the spacecraft beyond Earth's orbit.

In a crosswalk at rush hour, you thread your way through the oncoming crowd, your eyes passing over the faces before you. This wayfinding might feel like something you're doing on your own. But scientists who study the movements of crowds have found that a simple trip through a crowd is much more like a dance we perform with those around us.And so it might not come as too much of a surprise to learn that a person staring down at a phone, lost in a private world while walking, really messes with the vibe, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.Humans use a variety of visual cues to anticipate where other members of a crowd will go next, said Hisashi Murakami, a professor at Kyoto Institute of Technology and an author of the new paper. He was curious what would happen if attention to those details were disrupted, and so, in a series of outdoor experiments on the campus of the University of Tokyo, he and his colleagues filmed two groups of students in a walkway about 30 feet long.The groups walked toward each other at a normal pace. When the groups met, the students intuitively performed a maneuver familiar to those who study crowds: They formed lanes. When a person at the front of one group found a way through the oncoming group, others fell in behind that person, creating several ribbons of walkers going past one another. This was effortless, and almost instantaneous.The researchers then asked three of the students to perform a task on their phones while they walked — simple single-digit addition, not too taxing but enough to keep their gazes directed down instead of forward.When those students were placed at the back of their group, the distraction did not affect how the groups moved past each other. But when the distracted walkers were at the front of the pack, there was a dramatic slowdown in the whole group's walking pace. It also took longer for clear lanes to form.Distracted people also did not move smoothly. They took big steps sideways or dodged others in a way that the researchers rarely saw when there were no distractions. The inattentive pedestrians in the experiment induced that behavior in others as well; the people who weren't looking at their phones moved in a more choppy fashion than they did when there were no phone-gazers. It appeared that a few people not giving their full attention to navigation could change the behavior of the whole crowd of more than 50 people.Looking at one's phone might have that effect because it deprives others of the information contained in our gazes, the researchers suggest. Where we look as we move broadcasts details about where we intend to go next. Without that, it's harder for passers-by to avoid us gracefully. And merely dodging other people as we move along, eyes averted, rather than moving with purpose, makes us even more unpredictable.As more and more people use smartphones and other devices that contribute to distracted walking, it may be necessary for architects and city planners concerned with the movement of crowds to take that altered behavior into account, the researchers say.Dr. Murakami plans next to track people's eye movements as they walk past one another. He hopes that these studies will reveal how our gazes helps us navigate crowds — what messages we transmit about our next steps as we perform this daily ritual, all unknowing.

The pandemic has shed a blinding light on too many Americans' failure to follow the well-established scientific principles of personal health and well-being. There are several reasons this country, one of the world's richest and most highly developed, has suffered much higher rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths than many poorer and less well-equipped populations.Older Americans have been particularly hard hit by this novel coronavirus. When cases surged at the end of last year, Covid-19 became the nation's leading cause of death, deadlier than heart disease and cancer.But while there's nothing anyone can do to stop the march of time, several leading risk factors for Covid-19 infections and deaths stem from how many Americans conduct their lives from childhood on and their misguided reliance on medicine to patch up their self-inflicted wounds.After old age, obesity is the second leading risk factor for death among those who become infected and critically ill with Covid-19. Seventy percent of Americans adults are now overweight, and more than a third are obese. Two other major risks for Covid, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, are most often the result of excess weight, which in turn reflects unhealthy dietary and exercise habits. These conditions may be particularly prevalent in communities of color, who are likewise disproportionately affected by the pandemic.Several people I know packed on quite a few pounds of health-robbing body fat this past year, and not because they lacked the ability to purchase and consume a more nutritious plant-based diet or to exercise regularly within or outside their homes. One male friend in his 50s unexpectedly qualified for the Covid vaccine by having an underlying health condition when his doctor found he'd become obese since the pandemic began.A Harris Poll, conducted for the American Psychological Association in late February, revealed that 42 percent of respondents had gained an average of 29 "pandemic pounds," increasing their Covid risk.So what can we learn from these trends? Tom Vilsack, the new Secretary of Agriculture, put it bluntly a week ago in Politico Pro's Morning Agriculture newsletter: "We cannot have the level of obesity. We cannot have the level of diabetes we have. We cannot have the level of chronic disease … It will literally cripple our country."Of course, in recent decades many of the policies of the department Mr. Vilsack now heads have contributed mightily to Americans' access to inexpensive foods that flesh out their bones with unwholesome calories and undermine their health. Two telling examples: The government subsidizes the production of both soybeans and corn, most of which is used to feed livestock.Not only does livestock production make a major contribution to global warming, much of its output ends up as inexpensive, often highly processed fast foods that can prompt people to overeat and raise their risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease. But there are no subsidies for the kinds of fruits and vegetables that can counter the disorders that render people more vulnerable to the coronavirus.As Mr. Vilsack said, "The time has come for us to transform the food system in this country in an accelerated way."Early in the pandemic, when most businesses and entertainment venues were forced to close, toilet paper was not the only commodity stripped from market shelves. The country was suddenly faced with a shortage of flour and yeast as millions of Americans "stuck" at home went on a baking frenzy. While I understood their need to relieve stress, feel productive and perhaps help others less able or so inclined, bread, muffins and cookies were not the most wholesome products that might have emerged from pandemic kitchens.When calorie-rich foods and snacks are in the home, they can be hard to resist when there's little else to prompt the release of pleasure-enhancing brain chemicals. To no one's great surprise, smoking rates also rose during the pandemic, introducing yet another risk to Covid susceptibility.And there's been a run on alcoholic beverages. National sales of alcohol during one week in March 2020 were 54 percent higher than the comparable week the year before. The Harris Poll corroborated that nearly one adult in four drank more alcohol than usual to cope with pandemic-related stress. Not only is alcohol a source of nutritionally empty calories, its wanton consumption can result in reckless behavior that further raises susceptibility to Covid.Well before the pandemic prompted a rise in calorie consumption, Americans were eating significantly more calories each day than they realized, thanks in large part to the ready availability of ultra-processed foods, especially those that tease, "you can't eat just one." (Example: Corn on the cob is unprocessed, canned corn is minimally processed, but Doritos are ultra-processed).In a brief but carefully designed diet study, Kevin D. Hall and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health surreptitiously gave 20 adults diets that were rich in either ultra-processed foods or unprocessed foods matched for calorie, sugar, fat, sodium, fiber and protein content. Told to eat as much as they wanted, the unsuspecting participants consumed 500 calories a day more on the ultra-processed diet.If you've been reading my column for years, you already know that I'm not a fanatic when it comes to food. I have many containers of ice cream in my freezer; cookies, crackers and even chips in my cupboard; and I enjoy a burger now and then. But my daily diet is based primarily on vegetables, with fish, beans and nonfat milk my main sources of protein. My consumption of snacks and ice cream is portion-controlled and, along with daily exercise, has enabled me to remain weight-stable despite yearlong pandemic stress and occasional despair.As Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, says, "This is not rocket science." She does not preach deprivation, only moderation (except perhaps for a total ban on soda). "We need a national policy aimed at preventing obesity," she told me, "a national campaign to help all Americans get healthier."

SAN FRANCISCO — When the pandemic narrowed the world, Jonathan Hirshon stopped traveling, eating out, going to cocktail parties and commuting to the office.What a relief.Mr. Hirshon suffers from severe social anxiety. In the past, casual get-togethers and meetings came with a rapid heartbeat and clenched fists. He preferred to interact virtually, and welcomed the Zoom meetings that others merely tolerated. Even as he grieved the pandemic's toll, he found lockdown life to be a respite."There is cognitive dissonance to feeling good in the middle of the pandemic," he said.Now with normalcy about to return, Mr. Hirshon, a public relations consultant, finds himself with decidedly mixed feelings — "anticipation, dread and hope."Mr. Hirshon, 54, belongs to a subset of the population that finds the everyday grind not only wearing, but also emotionally unsettling. These include people with clinical diagnoses of anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, but also run-of-the-mill introverts, who are socially uncomfortable.A new survey from the American Psychological Association found that while 47 percent of people have seen their stress rise over the pandemic, about 43 percent saw no change in stress and 7 percent felt less stress.Mental health experts said this fraction of the population found the quarantine protective, a permission slip to glide into more predictable spaces, schedules, routines and relationships. And the experts warn that while quarantine has blessed the "avoidance" of social situations, the circumstances are poised to change."I am very worried about many of my socially anxious patients," said Andrea Maikovich-Fong, a psychologist in Denver. That anxiety "is going to come back with a vengeance when the world opens up."She doesn't for a moment diminish the larger picture of the pandemic's toll. Millions have died around the globe, and the plague itself has caused severe grief and anxiety — for parents and children, medical workers and those just trying to survive economically. The mental health industry, she said, "is struggling to keep up."But for people with severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, these sharp restrictions in some ways reinforced their intense impulse to withdraw.Early on in the pandemic, "these patients were feeling very vindicated," said Ms. Maikovich-Fong. For people who feared contact with other people or germs, "even the government was telling them that everything they thought they should be doing was the social norm."Now, she said, she's already seeing the discomfort set in for "some kids going back to school or adults who were working remotely.""There are a lot of people walking around with a false sense of security, who are a lot more comfortable than they were a year ago," she said. "That's not sustainable."This counterintuitive dynamic is playing out for teenagers and children, too.A study published in February in European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry looked at the mental health impact on 1,000 young people in Canada during the pandemic, and found that 70 percent of study subjects aged 6 to 18 reported some negative impact. But 19.5 percent in that age group saw some improvement, leading the authors to conclude of the impact: "Mostly worse; occasionally better."Researchers found that some children with social anxiety and learning disorders saw improvements in anxiety and depression. "The stay-at-home directives may have provided relief from sources of stress, therefore improving symptoms of anxiety or irritability," according to a summary of the research by the Hospital for Sick Kids, which is affiliated with the University of Toronto and supported the research.Ryan Fenstermacher, a high school senior in Connecticut (who asked that his city of residence not be published), said school can increase his social anxiety. "Like group projects, they're always terrible for me — my anxiety comes from not being able to predict what they're going to do, what they're going to say," he said. "There's no escape route."Not so when he's on Zoom. "You can turn off your camera, mute people online," he said.For some students, the return to the classroom is proving challenging because they've gotten accustomed to being offline. In Mountain View, Calif., an intensive therapy group is tackling teenage mental health challenges, and its participants include a new member as of mid-March: a 15-year-old who started with the group this week to try to cope with social anxiety.Her mother, who asked that their names be withheld to protect the girl from embarrassment or bullying, said that the girl, who is in 10th grade, appeared to have essentially forgotten how to socially interact. The idea of returning to school makes the adolescent terribly anxious and, absent therapy, "would be terrible news for her," her mother said.Mary Alvord, a psychologist who runs a large group practice in Maryland serving adolescents, said that many adolescents have suffered during the pandemic. "We don't want to diminish that," she said. But "there is a subset of kids who are doing better."Some adolescents, Dr. Alvord said, have found a respite from bullying and social anxiety, and students struggling in school now get more help from their parents and worry less about their in-classroom performance.Then there are the little ones."Kids will say, 'My mom used to travel all the time. I never even saw her and she was so tired, and now my parents are home all the time and they even play games with us,'" Dr. Alvord said.For some adults, the pandemic provided a glimpse into just how much anxiety they were experiencing on a regular basis. Josh Bernoff, a public speaker and author who lives in Arlington, Mass., said he was constantly stressed by traveling, figuring out where his next on-the-go meal was coming from and making socially awkward conversation with people he didn't know that well.Now, he says, "all my interactions are virtual, so I don't worry about shaking hands and the awkwardness of in-person.""When I go to bed at night, I know what I'm doing the next day, and I don't worry about it," said Mr. Bernoff. He loves the predictability of life — like what time he's having lunch and dinner and where it's coming from. "I hate to sound paranoid about this, but I like being in the same place as my refrigerator."Mr. Bernoff hastened to say he can't wait for the pandemic to end — "and go to dinner with my wife.""I don't want this to go on forever," he added, "but for just this year, this period, it's been a little island of stability."Mr. Bernoff is fortunate to have consistent work; research shows that anxiety and depression triggered by the pandemic can disproportionately impact those with shakier economic prospects. A large-scale study of 36,000 subjects in the United Kingdom, published in the December 2020 issue of The Lancet, found that mental health challenges were elevated for some people early in the lockdown and then eased in general as the lockdown eased, with some groups more susceptible than others."Being female or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms at the start of lockdown," the study found. That began to ebb, the researchers found, as people acclimated and lockdowns eased.By contrast, the anxiety-ridden people who experienced relief during the pandemic probably are in higher income brackets, said Ms. Maikovich-Fong, the therapist from Denver. They are more likely to have jobs they can do remotely, allowing them to remain employed but with less stress than before.In the end, that relief may not only prove temporary but also actually intensify anxiety as people try to re-engage."The more you avoid something that makes you anxious, the harder it is to do," said Martin Antony, a psychology professor at Ryerson University in Toronto and an expert in phobia and anxiety. He added of people with more extreme cases: "They may find when the pandemic ends, it's much more difficult."

Amazon workers at a giant warehouse in Alabama voted decisively against forming a union on Friday, squashing the most significant labor drive in the internet giant's history and dealing a crushing blow to organizers, Democrats and their allies when conditions have appeared ripe for unions to make advances.Workers cast 1,798 votes against a union, giving Amazon enough to emphatically defeat the effort. Ballots in favor of a union trailed at 738, fewer than 30 percent of the votes tallied, according to federal officials.The lopsided outcome at the 6,000-person warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., came even as the pandemic's effect on the economy and the election of a pro-labor president had made the country more aware of the plight of essential workers.Amazon, which has repeatedly quashed labor activism, had appeared vulnerable as it faced increasing scrutiny in Washington and around the world for its market power and influence. President Biden signaled support for the union effort, as did Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. The pandemic, which drove millions of people to shop online, also raised questions about Amazon's ability to keep those employees safe.But in an aggressive campaign, the company argued that its workers had access to rewarding jobs without needing to involve a union. The victory leaves Amazon free to handle employees on its own terms as it has gone on a hiring spree and expanded its work force to more than 1.3 million people.Margaret O'Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of technology companies, said Amazon's message that it offered good jobs with good wages had prevailed over the criticisms by the union and its supporters. The outcome, she said, "reads as a vindication."She added that while it was just one warehouse, the election had garnered so much attention that it had become a "bellwether." Amazon's victory was likely to cause organized labor to think, "Maybe this isn't worth trying in other places," Ms. O'Mara said.The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which led the drive, blamed its defeat on what it said were Amazon's anti-union tactics before and during the voting, which was conducted from early February through the end of last month. The union said it would challenge the result and ask federal labor officials to investigate Amazon for creating an "atmosphere of confusion, coercion and/or fear of reprisals.""Our system is broken," said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president. "Amazon took full advantage of that."Amazon said in a statement, "The union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that's not true." It added, "Amazon didn't win — our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union."About half of the 5,876 eligible voters at the warehouse cast ballots in the election. A majority of votes, or 1,521, was needed to win. About 500 ballots were contested, largely by Amazon, the union said. Those ballots were not counted. If a union had been voted through, it would have been the first for Amazon workers in the United States.

The lopsided vote against a union at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., was a major disappointment to organized labor, which regards the fight with Amazon as central to labor's survival. Yet the defeat doesn't mark the end of the campaign against Amazon so much as a shift in strategy.In interviews, labor leaders said they would step up their informal efforts to highlight and resist the company's business and labor practices rather than seek elections at individual job sites, as in Bessemer. The approach includes everything from walkouts and protests to public relations campaigns that draw attention to Amazon's leverage over its customers and competitors."We're focused on building a new type of labor movement where we don't rely on the election process to raise standards," said Jesse Case, secretary-treasurer of a Teamsters local in Iowa that is seeking to rally the state's Amazon drivers and warehouse workers to pressure the company.The strategy reflects a paradox of the labor movement: While the Gallup Poll has found that roughly two-thirds of Americans approve of unions — up from half in 2009, a low point — it has rarely been more difficult to unionize a large company.One reason is that labor law gives employers sizable advantages. The law typically forces workers to win elections at individual work sites of a company like Amazon, which would mean hundreds of separate campaigns. It allows employers to campaign aggressively against unions and does little to punish employers that threaten or retaliate against workers who try to organize.Lawyers representing management say that union membership has declined — from about one-third of private-sector workers in the 1950s to just over 6 percent today — because employers have gotten better at addressing workers' needs. "Employees have access to the company in order to express any concerns they might have," said Michael J. Lotito of the firm Littler Mendelson.But labor leaders say wealthy, powerful companies have grown much bolder in pressing the advantages that labor law affords them.Before Amazon, few companies better epitomized this posture than Walmart, which union leaders targeted in the 1990s and 2000s, convinced that the retail giant was driving down wages and benefits across the retail industry.Walmart, in turn, took sometimes drastic steps to keep unions at bay. In 2000, after a small group of meat cutters at a Texas store decided to unionize, the company eliminated the position across other stores. Five years later, when workers at a Walmart in Quebec were seeking to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, the company shut the store. Walmart said the store was not performing well financially."Everywhere they tried, they were defeated,'' Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said of the unions. "Walmart would send teams to swamp the stores to work against a union. They are good at it."As with Walmart, labor leaders believed it was critical to establish a foothold at Amazon, which influences pay and working conditions for millions of workers thanks to the competitive pressure it puts on rivals in industries like groceries and fashion.But the labor movement's failure to make inroads at Walmart despite investing millions of dollars has loomed over its thinking on Amazon. "They felt so burned by trying to organize Walmart and getting basically nowhere," said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.It was only a relatively small, scrappy union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, that felt the election in Alabama was worth the large investment. As the votes were being tallied, Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president, attributed the one-sided result to a "broken" election system that favors employers.Amazon saw things differently. "It's easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that's not true," the company said in a statement. "Our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union. Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we've always worked hard to listen to them."Yet even as elections have often proven futile, labor has enjoyed some success over the years with an alternative model — what Dr. Milkman called the "air war plus ground war."The idea is to combine workplace actions like walkouts (the ground war) with pressure on company executives through public relations campaigns that highlight labor conditions and enlist the support of public figures (the air war). The Service Employees International Union used the strategy to organize janitors beginning in the 1980s, and to win gains for fast-food workers in the past few years, including wage increases across the industry."There are almost never any elections," Dr. Milkman said. "It's all about putting pressure on decision makers at the top."In some respects, labor's effort to gain traction at Amazon had begun to follow this playbook before the campaign in Alabama. In early 2019, Mr. Appelbaum's union, working with nonprofit organizations, local politicians and other labor groups, helped scuttle a deal that would have brought a second Amazon headquarters to New York by drawing attention to the company's anti-union posture.That fall, several nonprofit groups formed a coalition, called Athena, to help persuade Americans that the company was a monopolist and that it exploited workers. And during the pandemic, Amazon workers around the country have joined groups and staged walkouts to amplify their concerns about safety and pay.Labor leaders and progressive activists and politicians said they intended to escalate both the ground war and the air war against Amazon after the failed union election, though some skeptics within the labor movement are likely to resist spending more revenue, which is in the billions of dollars a year but declining.More than 1,000 Amazon workers across the country have contacted the retail workers union in recent months and many appear to be girding for confrontation with the company.Mr. Appelbaum said in an interview that elections should remain an important part of labor's Amazon strategy. "I think we opened the door," he said. "If you want to build real power, you have to do it with a majority of workers."But other leaders said elections should be de-emphasized. Mr. Case said the Teamsters were trying to organize Amazon workers in Iowa so they could take actions like labor stoppages and enlist members of the community — for example, by turning them out for rallies.Late last year, a nonprofit group called the Solidarity Fund invited tech industry workers to apply for stipends that would help fund their organizing efforts. According to Jess Kutch, the group's executive director, Amazon employees claimed about half of the roughly $100,000 that the group has distributed, reflecting the growing activism of its employees.As for external pressure, progressive groups said they intended to draw attention to a broad range of concerns about Amazon, from its power over small businesses to the potentially questionable uses of its home security technology, Ring."We will be raising questions around Ring and the breadth of agreements they have with local police departments," as they relate to surveillance of people of color, said Lauren Jacobs, a longtime labor organizer who now runs the Partnership for Working Families, a network that seeks to reduce economic inequality and that is a co-founder of the Athena coalition.Many labor officials urged Congress to increase its scrutiny of Amazon's labor practices, including its use of mandatory meetings, texts and signs to discourage workers in Alabama from unionizing. "There have to be consequences for people like Bezos," said Richard Bensinger, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. organizing director who is advising workers at other Amazon facilities, referring to Jeff Bezos, the company's founder. "We need congressional hearings to publicize this stuff."Some members of Congress indicated that they would heed this call. "How long will Jeff Bezos thumb his nose at the United States Senate?" Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview, citing Mr. Bezos's refusal to appear at a recent Senate hearing on executive pay. "He has done it in the past, but the winds are blowing from a different direction today."Other labor leaders said the loss in Alabama should prompt Congress to rewrite labor law to make it easier for workers to form unions. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which the House passed last month, would outlaw mandatory anti-union meetings and impose penalties on employers who violate labor law. (There are currently no financial penalties for doing so.)But after Bessemer, many labor leaders think Congress should go further, letting workers unionize companywide or industrywide, not just by work site as is typical. The loss "can be an opportunity to look beyond the PRO Act and why we need labor law with a focus on the sector," Larry Cohen, chairman of the progressive advocacy group Our Revolution and a former president of the Communications Workers of America, said in a text message.Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, agreed that the key to taking on a company as powerful as Amazon was to make it easier for workers to unionize across a company or industry. "It's not going to happen one warehouse at a time," she said.But Ms. Henry said workers and politicians could pressure Amazon to come to the bargaining table long before the law formally requires it — in the same way that President Biden warned that there should be no intimidation or coercion during the Alabama union election."It would be incredibly powerful if Biden and Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh called on McDonald's and Amazon and other major corporations to set a bargaining table with workers and government and they would help support it," she said.Michael Corkery contributed reporting.

NEW DELHI — When the coronavirus first struck India last year, the country enforced one of the world's strictest national lockdowns. The warning was clear: A fast spread in a population of 1.3 billion would be devastating.Though damaging and ultimately flawed, the lockdown and other efforts appeared to work. Infections dropped and deaths remained low. Officials and the public dropped their guard. Experts warned fruitlessly that the government's haphazard approach would bring a crisis when a new wave appeared.Now the crisis is here.India on Friday reported a daily record of 131,878 new infections as Covid-19 races out of control. Deaths, while still relatively low, are rising. Vaccinations, a mammoth task in such a large nation, are dangerously behind schedule. Hospital beds are running short.Parts of the country are reinforcing lockdowns. Scientists are rushing to track new strains, including the more hazardous variants found in Britain and South Africa, that may be hastening the spread. But the authorities have declared contact tracing in some places to be simply impossible.Complacency and government missteps have helped turned India from a seeming success story into one of the world's worst-hit places, experts say. And epidemiologists warn that continuing failure in India would have global implications.But politicians in India, still stinging from the pain of the last national lockdown, have mostly avoided major restrictions and have even returned to holding big election rallies, sending mixed messages to the public. India's vaccine rollout was late and riddled with setbacks, despite the country's status as a major pharmaceutical manufacturer.The sheer number of infections during the first wave led some to believe the worst was over. India's youthful population, less susceptible to symptoms and death, created misperceptions about how damaging another outbreak could be.What India needs now, epidemiologists and experts say, is concerted and consistent leadership to contain infections and buy time to make vaccinations more widely available and faster."Public behavior and administrative behavior matters," said Dr. K Sreenath Reddy, the chairman of Public Health Foundation of India. "If we do something for six weeks, or four weeks, and then declare victory and again open the door wide open, then we are in trouble." A stricken India will set back the global effort. The government has restricted vaccine exports to the country's own needs. If inoculations don't quicken, India would need more than two years to inoculate 70 percent of its population, said Dr. Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, with headquarters in Washington and New Delhi."India's size is going to to dominate the global numbers — how the world performs on Covid is going to be very dependent on how India performs on Covid," Dr. Laxminarayan said. "If it is not over in India, it is not really over in the world."Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday played down the possibility of another countrywide lockdown, instead pushing for "micro containment zones." He said India could contain a second wave with "test, track, treat, and Covid-appropriate behavior."Mr. Modi's officials have blamed mismanagement by state governments, and the population's flouting of safety measures such as masks and social distancing, for the new wave.The roots of India's crisis lie in the previous one. The coronavirus hit the country hard, and India long held the second-largest number of infections after the United States. (It is now behind the United States and Brazil.) The economic blowback of the resulting lockdown was devastating.But the numbers at the time actually understated the first wave, scientists now say, and deaths in India never matched levels of the United States or Britain. Leaders began acting as if the problem had been solved.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETPfizer and BioNTech requested the F.D.A.'s authorization to use their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination.Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations.But improvements in testing capacity have led to more accurate counts this time. The virus likely raced through some populations like the urban poor, infecting between 300 and 500 million people, Dr. Laxminarayan estimates. While they may have won a level of immunity, that led to a lull until the virus hit others."The sad thing is that in a country like India, you can have 400 million infections, but that means 900 million people are not yet infected," Dr. Laxminarayan said.The mortality data was also misleading. Official figures show about 167,000 deaths, or 0.04 per 100,000 people, an astonishingly low rate compared with other countries. But about two-thirds of the population here is younger than 35. Among people between 45 and 75, fatality rates could be on par with or worse than Italy, Brazil, and the United States, Dr. Laxminarayan said.India's vaccine preparedness was also worse than it seemed. For months, the Serum Institute of India, one of the world's largest vaccine makers, boasted of a major stockpile of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which makes up the bulk of the country's drive. The government even launched a "vaccine diplomacy" campaign that sent doses to other countries.But the initial rollout within India was slowed by complacency and plagued with public skepticism, including questions about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and lack of disclosure about an Indian-developed dose. Now the vaccination program is not matching the spread. The Serum Institute has said that practically all of its daily production of about two million doses will over the next two months go to the government, delaying commitments to other countries.Several Indian states now worry that their vaccines stocks will run out. Mumbai, India's largest city, had shut more than half of its vaccination centers, local media reported on Friday. The central government's health minister lashed out at the states, reassuring that there would be no shortage and that more supplies were in the pipeline.Still, many people shed masks and resumed normal life.In Pune, one of the worst-afflicted places in the hard-hit state of Maharashtra, relaxed attitudes and an overwhelming proportion of largely asymptomatic cases worsened the spread, said Sudhir Mehta, the response coordinator there. The district of about 10 million people reported more than 12,000 new cases on Friday, while the cumulative death toll has crossed 10,000. In a letter to the central government, Mr. Mehta described transmission as so rampant that contact tracing was almost impossible."There are so many mild cases where people even don't realize that they have Covid," Mr. Mehta said in an interview. (The positivity rate for tests in Maharashtra over the past week was one quarter, compared with a roughly 8 percent national average.)Some of the relaxed attitude comes from the top. India's senior leaders, who have taken vaccines publicly to support the inoculation effort, have been urging people to take precautions even as they hit the campaign trail for state elections. Prime Minister Modi has addressed more than 20 rallies, each with thousands of often-unmasked people.On Wednesday, Delhi officials said that even a solo car driver would be punished for not wearing a mask properly. The same day, Amit Shah, the country's de facto No. 2 leader, drove through a campaign crowd in the state of West Bengal, waving without a mask and throwing rose petals.The government also gave the go ahead for a long Hindu religious festival called Kumbh Mela, which runs through the end of April. Between one million to five million people attend the festival each day in the city of Haridwar, on the banks of the river Ganges in the state of Uttarakhand.Tirath Singh Rawat, the state's chief minister, said no one would face restrictions as "the faith in God will overcome the fear of Covid-19." Days later, Mr. Rawat tested positive for Covid.The positivity rate of random tests is rising at the festival, and more than 300 participants have tested positive, said Dr. Arjun Singh Senger, a health officer at the festival.The sheer speed of new infections has surprised health officials, who wonder whether variants might be a factor. Answering that question will be difficult. India has put only about 1 percent of its cases through genome sequencing tests, according to Dr. Reddy, of the Public Health Foundation of India, but researchers require a minimum of 5 percent to determine what is circulating.So far, the government has found variants from the U.K. and South Africa as well as a local mutation. Limited information suggests that more infectious variants are circulating in India, as well, Dr. Reddy said.Even if the variants have not yet been a major part of the new wave of infections, they have cast a shadow over India's crucial vaccination drive. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been rejected by South Africa as ineffective against that variant."This time, the speed is much faster than the last time," said Dr. Vinod K. Paul, the head of India's Covid response task force. "The next four weeks are very, very crucial for us."

President Biden's $1.52 trillion spending proposal released on Friday calls for a vast infusion of funds across federal agencies, with proposals for billions of dollars in additional spending in areas like education, public health, climate change and housing.The plan, which does not include Mr. Biden's sprawling infrastructure proposals, is for the 2022 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.It represents a sharp break from the budget priorities of President Donald J. Trump, who sought to cut funding for domestic programs.Here are some of the notable parts of Mr. Biden's plan.Fighting climate change across agencies.Mr. Biden's spending proposal would significantly increase government spending to fight and adapt to the damages of a warming planet.He proposes more than $14 billion in additional funding compared with the 2021 year, with that money infused across nearly every federal agency.The broad-based increase in climate spending would come on top of clean energy spending in Mr. Biden's proposed infrastructure legislation, which would pour roughly $500 billion on programs like increasing electric vehicle production and building climate-resilient roads and bridges.Over all, the Energy Department would see its funding increased by $4.3 billion, or 10.2 percent over the 2021 fiscal year, including additional money to research and develop technologies like new nuclear power plants or hydrogen fuels. It also includes $1.9 billion for a new initiative that would help deploy low-carbon energy projects around the county and speed up permitting for transmission lines.The spending plan would also increase funding for the Environmental Protection Agency to $11.2 billion, $2 billion more than the 2021 fiscal year enacted level, including about $110 million to restore hundreds of positions left vacant after employees left the agency in recent years.And it would fund what the White House calls "the largest investment in environmental justice in history," requesting $1.4 billion for programs to redress the disproportionate effects of pollution borne by poor and minority communities.The budget outline aims to embed climate programs into agencies that have not historically been seen at the forefront of tackling global warming. For instance, the Agriculture Department would receive an additional $161 million for programs to measure and verify actions that farmers take to sequester more carbon dioxide in their soil, $100 million to create jobs plugging methane leaks from abandoned oil and gas wells, and a $40 million increase for "climate hubs" that aim to give farmers more information about the effects of climate change on agriculture. The Pentagon's overall spending request of $715 billion includes spending on programs to make military bases more resilient to the effects of climate change, like stronger storms and rising sea levels. — Coral Davenport, Lisa Friedman and Brad PlumerIncreasing education funding for high-poverty schools.The Biden administration is asking Congress to raise funding for high-poverty schools by $20 billion, which it describes as the largest year-over-year increase to the Title I program since its inception under President Lyndon B. Johnson.The proposal also asks for billions of dollars in increases to early-childhood education, programs serving students with disabilities and efforts to staff schools with nurses, counselors and mental health professionals — described as an attempt to help children recover from the pandemic, but also a longstanding priority for teachers unions and other education advocates.The maximum Pell grant for college students of modest means would rise by $400, the largest increase since 2009, and the grants would be available to so-called Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children.Mr. Biden is also looking to further expand funding for Head Start programs, which provide early intervention education and support for low-income students. The administration asked for $1.2 billion more in funding for it, in addition to $1 billion provided in Mr. Biden's coronavirus relief package. — Dana Goldstein and Katie RogersMore health funding amid the pandemic.Mr. Biden's plan calls for an almost 25 percent increase in discretionary funding — to $131.7 billion — for the Department of Health and Human Services, the hub of the federal government's pandemic response.That includes a $1.6 billion increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that public health experts have viewed as chronically underfunded and neglected until public health emergencies. Data collection would be modernized, and epidemiologists would be trained to support local health departments.Almost a billion dollars would go to the Strategic National Stockpile, the country's emergency medical reserve, for supplies and efforts to restructure it that began last year.The plan also calls for $6.5 billion for a new agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health — part of a requested $51 billion for the typically well-funded National Institutes of Health. The agency would fund federal research, with a focus on cancer and diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETPfizer and BioNTech requested the F.D.A.'s authorization to use their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination.Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations.Outside of pandemic response, the White House wants to expand spending in several areas that were also budget priorities for the Trump administration, like fighting the opioid epidemic and H.I.V. and AIDS.But on other matters, it diverges clearly from Trump administration policies. The Biden spending proposal would expand spending on the Title X program that provides family-planning services to low-income Americans. Under Mr. Trump, that program was retooled to reduce the number of eligible providers. The plan would also double spending on research into the causes of gun-related deaths and injuries, a long-neglected area because of its political overtones.But most health spending by the federal government is not discretionary, meaning the proposal released on Friday does not show what the Biden administration hopes to do in Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. — Margot Sanger-Katz and Noah WeilandDealing with border security and immigration.The spending request reflected an increasing sense of urgency within the Biden administration to deter migration to the southwestern border, including $1.2 billion toward investing in border security technology, like sensors to detect illegal crossings and tools to improve entry ports.The request does not seek any new funding for the border wall construction begun under Mr. Trump.Mr. Biden also proposed $4.3 billion to speed up the release of minors to sponsors in the United States, to assist minors in immigration court proceedings and to provide mental health services to children separated from their parents under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which led to the separation of thousands of immigrant families.The funds would also be spent on processing more refugees displaced overseas. Mr. Biden has pledged to raise the cap on refugee admissions from the historically low annual cap of 15,000, although he has yet to sign the emergency determination.The administration is scrambling to find shelter space for children and teenagers crossing the border without their parents. Nearly 5,000 are backed up into border detention facilities because of the lack of capacity in the shelters managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.Mr. Biden, who campaigned on increasing oversight over Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is requesting an additional $84 million for those agencies over the 2021 enacted funds. The money would be used to improve investigations of work force complaints, "including those related to white supremacy or ideological and nonideological beliefs." — Zolan Kanno-YoungsMore money for federal housing assistance.The proposal includes a major expansion of housing programs for low-income families and the homeless, with Mr. Biden requesting a $9 billion increase in the budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.That is on top of the $213 billion slated for housing in the infrastructure plan, which could transform an agency relegated to backwater status under Mr. Trump into a key player in Mr. Biden's efforts to target structural racial and economic inequality.The plan includes a significant expansion of federal housing assistance voucher programs, the main conduit for low-income housing funding, adding an additional 200,000 families to the 2.3 million already on the rolls. That alone would account for a $5.4 billion increase in the department's annual budget.The spending proposal would also further the anti-discrimination agenda championed by the department's new secretary, Marcia L. Fudge, by funding "mobility-related supportive services" to make it easier for families to move into more racially, ethnically and economically diverse neighborhoods.The plan also includes $500 million in additional funding for homeless programs, targeting more than 100,000 additional households, including domestic violence survivors and homeless youth. That funding is in addition to the $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers already provided in Mr. Biden's pandemic relief bill. — Glenn ThrushBolstering labor enforcement.The spending proposal would fund the Labor Department at $14.2 billion, a 14 percent increase. That includes a 17 percent increase for the department's enforcement agencies, like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the agency responsible for ensuring that workers are protected from the coronavirus.OSHA was widely criticized last year for failing to adequately inspect worksites in industries like meatpacking, where thousands of workers became infected. According to a report by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, the agency had fewer than 900 inspectors at the outset of 2020, the smallest number in more than 40 years.The Biden administration has also proposed an increase in the funding that states receive to administer unemployment insurance, including an update in the formula that allocates such funds and $100 million to upgrade information technology. — Noam ScheiberA modest increase in defense spending.The White House requested a 1.7 percent increase for defense spending and said it would prioritize China as the Pentagon's "top challenge" while also seeking to deter what it calls "destabilizing behavior" from Russia.The proposal also places funding for the United States' overseas combat operations into the Pentagon's budget, ending the practice of requesting those funds separately.Several large procurement programs begun by previous administrations remain, like the effort to modernize America's nuclear arsenal and build new submarines capable of firing nuclear missiles, as well as the Pentagon's efforts to create new long-range and hypersonic weapons.The coronavirus's effects on the military, which have sidelined warships and caused outbreaks on bases ashore, are reflected in requests for funding to better monitor emerging infectious diseases in cooperation with allies and to develop medical countermeasures.The Pentagon is currently engaged in what it calls a "global posture review" that is assessing which weapons, vehicles and bases are necessary for the threats it sees the military needing to address, and the plan notes that some existing programs will be defunded — with that money redirected toward those it finds are needed to address the national security challenges identified by that study. — John IsmayAt the State Department, preventing future pandemics and migration.The spending plan increases support for two of Mr. Biden's top priorities with foreign roots: curbing the pandemic and halting migration from Central America.It calls for $10 billion for global health programs — including, notably, $1 billion for security efforts to detect, prevent and respond to future pandemics.It also would provide $861 million to combat corruption, prevent violence, reduce poverty and bolster economies in Central America in an attempt to curb the flow of thousands of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who head to the southwestern border each year. The money would be the first tranche of a four-year plan to ultimately spend $4 billion to help stabilize those countries and end the migrants' need to flee.Over all, the spending blueprint calls for $63.5 billion for the State Department and international programs — a nearly 12 percent increase from current spending levels of $56.7 billion. Officials said that would include funds to grow the number of career diplomats and Civil Service employees. — Lara JakesA beefed-up Internal Revenue Service.The Biden spending proposal makes good on the administration's belief that a modernized Internal Revenue Service is needed to properly administer the tax system and that investing in tax collection will pay for itself.The proposal asks for $14.9 billion for the Treasury Department, including $13.2 billion for the I.R.S. That is a 10.4 percent increase above current funding levels for the tax collection agency. The additional money would go toward increased oversight of tax returns of high-income individuals and companies and to improve customer service at the I.R.S.The additional money for the Treasury Department would also be used for bolstering Community Development Financial Institutions, a tool that Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen views as critical to helping minority communities gain access to capital. It would also bolster the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to help ensure that criminals cannot take advantage of financial reporting loopholes. — Alan Rappeport

WASHINGTON — President Biden on Friday ordered a 180-day study of adding seats to the Supreme Court, making good on a campaign-year promise to establish a bipartisan commission to examine the potentially explosive subjects of expanding the court or setting term limits for justices.The president acted under pressure from activists pushing for more seats to alter the ideological balance of the court after President Donald J. Trump appointed three justices, including one to a seat that Republicans had blocked his predecessor, Barack Obama, from filling for almost a year.The result is a court with a stronger conservative tilt, now 6 to 3, after the addition of Mr. Trump's choices, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just days before last year's presidential election.But while Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asserted that the system of judicial nominations is "getting out of whack," he has declined to say whether he supports altering the size of the court or making other changes — like imposing term limits — to the current system of lifetime appointments.It is not clear that the commission established by Mr. Biden will by itself clarify his position. Under the White House order establishing it, the commission is not set to issue specific recommendations at the end of its study — an outcome that is likely to disappoint activists.In his executive order on Friday, the president created a 36-member commission charged with examining the history of the court, past changes to the process of nominating justices, and the potential consequences to altering the size of the nation's highest court.The panel will be led by Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel for Mr. Obama, and Cristina Rodriguez, a Yale Law School professor who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Obama.Progressives say that Republicans unfairly gained an advantage on the court by blocking Mr. Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland in 2016, and they see adding seats to the court, setting term limits or instituting other changes as a way to offset the power of any one president to influence its makeup. Conservatives have denounced the effort as "court-packing" similar to the failed effort by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s.The issue of whether to alter the size of the court, which has been set at nine members since just after the Civil War, is highly charged, particularly when Congress is almost evenly divided between the two parties. An attempt by Mr. Biden to increase the number of justices would require approval of Congress and would be met by fierce opposition.The commission is intended to provide a forum to debate the issue that is protected from the passions that will continue to rage in the political arena, according to people familiar with Mr. Biden's intentions.The president understands, they said, that changes to the size of the court, or limitations on the length of time that a justice can serve, would be "reforms for the ages" that would have far-reaching implications for the courts for decades, not just during Mr. Biden's time in office.During his campaign for president, activists urged Mr. Biden to promise that he would expand the court as a way of countering the conservative mark that Mr. Trump was able to put on the institution. In addition to Justice Barrett, Mr. Trump also appointed Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch."There's growing recognition that the Supreme Court poses a danger to the health and well-being of the nation and even to democracy itself," said Aaron Belkin, the director of the group Take Back the Court. "A White House judicial reform commission has a historic opportunity to explain the gravity of the threat and to help contain it by urging Congress to add seats, which is the only way to restore balance to the court."Mr. Biden has refused to clarify his view on the issue and instead, in an interview on "60 Minutes" in October, promised to create a commission."I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system, because it's getting out of whack," he told Norah O'Donnell of CBS News.Mr. Biden may get his own chance to shape the court this year if Justice Stephen G. Breyer retires at the end of the current term. Justice Breyer, 82, is the oldest member of the court and the senior member of its three-justice liberal wing. Progressive groups are becoming increasingly aggressive in demanding that he step aside while Democrats still control the Senate and the confirmation process.But Justice Breyer warned this week that efforts to expand the court for political reasons could undermine the trust that the public has in the court and the decisions that it makes on important issues."I hope and expect that the court will retain its authority," he said. "But that authority, like the rule of law, depends on trust, a trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics. Structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that perception, further eroding that trust."Activists who say a larger court would give Mr. Biden the chance to appoint a number of liberal justices may be disappointed by his commission. People familiar with its charge from the president said the group will avoid making any recommendations to Mr. Biden or lawmakers.Instead, the panel of scholars, lawyers, political scientists and former judges will produce a research paper designed to be an authoritative analysis of the issue. The goal, the people said, is not to settle on an answer, but to provide Mr. Biden, members of Congress and the public an evaluation of the risks and benefits of making changes to the court.In a statement to be released Friday, the White House said the commission would examine "the genesis of the reform debate and the court's role in the constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the court; the membership and size of the court; and the court's case selection, rules, and practices."The commission's members include liberal scholars like Laurence H. Tribe, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and a leading progressive voice in the legal community, and Caroline Fredrickson, the former president of the American Constitution Society.But progressives may balk at some of the conservative members of the commission. They include: Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who was a top Justice Department official under President George W. Bush; Adam White, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School; and Keith E. Whittington, a professor of politics at Princeton University who takes an "originalist" view of the Constitution.People familiar with Mr. Biden's selections for the commission said they expected some members to offer evidence promoting the benefits of making changes to the court, while others would emphasize the costs or consequences of altering the current method of selecting justices. Those discussions will be presented in the report, which is set to be finished in October.In his order, Mr. Biden instructed the commission to hold public hearings on the issue and to accept testimony and submissions from other legal experts, organizations and members of the public who want to weigh in.Among the questions that he wants answered: How should the strengths and weaknesses of proposals to expand the court be evaluated? Would expansion require other reforms, such as the creation of a panel system for sittings? How does the history of efforts to expand or contract the size of the court bear on the questions being debated?

WASHINGTON — Roberta S. Jacobson, the former ambassador to Mexico whom President Biden chose as his "border czar" on the National Security Council, will step down at the end of the month, she said on Friday, even as the administration struggles to confront a surge of migrants at the nation's southwestern border.Ms. Jacobson, who had been described as one of the Biden administration's key players in dealing with the governments in the Northern Triangle area of Central America, praised what she called Mr. Biden's efforts to repair and recast the nation's immigration system after four years under President Donald J. Trump."They continue to drive toward the architecture that the president has laid out: an immigration system that is humane, orderly and safe," she said in a brief interview. "I leave optimistically. The policy direction is so clearly right for our country."Ms. Jacobson said that her appointment as a special assistant to the president and as the border coordinator in the White House was always intended to last for only about 100 days — a period that will expire at the end of April, when she intends to leave government.The timing of her departure is nonetheless striking, coming in the middle of the administration's efforts to reduce the flow of immigration from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Ms. Jacobson had been charged with leading that effort when her appointment was announced this year.Republican critics say that Mr. Biden's decision to quickly reverse many of the harshest Trump-era immigration policies in his first days in office has encouraged a new wave of migration from Central America, including families and children traveling to the border alone.Biden administration officials, including Ms. Jacobson, have argued that the increased flow of migration needs to be addressed at its source: primarily in Central American countries where violence, war, poverty, gangs and natural disasters are forcing people to flee their homes for refuge in the United States.But her role as one of the administration's top border officials was eclipsed late last month when Mr. Biden announced that Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the government's diplomatic efforts with that region.In the interview, Ms. Jacobson said the president's move to put Ms. Harris in charge of the effort to stem migration from Central America was not a factor in her decision to leave or her timing."I briefed and worked in support of the vice president's leadership on this issue," Ms. Jacobson said. "Nobody could be more delighted to see the vice president take on that role. It didn't have anything to do with my decision."Two weeks ago, in a separate interview with The New York Times, Ms. Jacobson talked expansively about her plans to travel to Central America, where she said she expected to work with government officials on reducing the flow of migrants north toward the United States.Last month, she traveled to Mexico to discuss with leaders there ways to combat illegal immigration and bolster shelter capacity for migrants. Ms. Jacobson said in the interview that the trip was also an attempt to find ways to collaborate with Central American countries, as well as potentially Canada, to reduce pressure on the United States border."I would say that we're — we're having the beginnings of those conversations," she said. "But right now, we're focused more on how we can work with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries."In early March, Ms. Jacobson faced questions from reporters at the White House and sought to discourage migrants from journeying to the United States. She echoed the administration's message that the border with Mexico remained closed.But when she tried to translate that blunt message into Spanish, she accidentally reversed its meaning, saying, "La frontera no esta cerrada," which in English is "the border is not closed." Later in the briefing, she corrected herself, translating the message correctly.Mr. Biden's decision to put Ms. Harris in charge of Central American diplomacy was seen at the time as an effort by the White House to send a message that the administration was taking the border issue seriously.It also served as the first substantive policy directive for the vice president, who has been at Mr. Biden's side since they took office but had not been given oversight of any particular part of the Biden agenda.Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, said in a statement that "there was no person better to usher in a more safe, secure and just approach to our southern border" than Ms. Jacobson.He said she leaves the administration "having shaped our relationship with Mexico as an equal partner, having launched our renewed efforts with the Northern Triangle nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and having underscored this administration's commitment to re-energizing the U.S. immigration system."Ms. Jacobson said that she remained confident that the administration would continue to make progress in persuading the leaders of Mexico and the Central American countries to work with the United States to slow the pace of migration."They know it is something that can't happen overnight," she said of her colleagues in the Biden administration. But she added that officials in the other countries were motivated to find solutions, as well."Diplomacy is a conversation," she said. "It's not a monologue."

BOULDER, Colo. — Teri Leiker and Clint Ponsford shared a love story that began and ended at the grocery store.They spent more than 30 years working at the same King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, where Ms. Leiker charmed customers with her big laugh and Mr. Ponsford could spot the peaks of the Flatirons when he went outside to wrangle shopping carts. They had both competed in Colorado's Special Olympics and helped each other get through a lot: deaths, a breakup and the challenges of navigating this world as two people with cognitive disabilities.About a year and a half ago, their friendship turned into something deeper. They went on karaoke dates. They watched Disney movies that Ms. Leiker adored. On workdays, they would get up at 3:30 a.m. in Ms. Leiker's condo to make coffee, trade kisses and watch reruns of "Murder, She Wrote" before Mr. Ponsford left for the early shift.And on March 22, they were both at work when it was all blasted apart.For a few fleeting days, the country's horrified gaze was fixed on Boulder after Ms. Leiker, 51, and nine other people at the King Soopers were killed by a 21-year-old gunman whose motives remain a mystery. Inevitably, the national attention drifted away, to shootings that claimed four lives at a Southern California real estate office or five at a doctor's home in South Carolina, to the Washington leaders, once again, vowing to either pass or prevent new gun restrictions.But that gray Boulder afternoon has not faded for Mr. Ponsford. As funerals for victims are held this week, he and other survivors and families are just beginning to cope with the anger, grief and empty spaces in their lives."I know she's gone, but why?" Mr. Ponsford, 62, said one afternoon as he sat at one of the college burger joints that Ms. Leiker liked, where she would sneak fries from friends' plates. "Why did this happen? Why did he take my girlfriend?"His brother Tyson sat nearby as Mr. Ponsford talked about finding Ms. Leiker and losing her. Mr. Ponsford had stayed at his brother's home just after the shooting, and other family visited for Easter so they could all spend time together."He's having a rough go of it the last couple days," Tyson Ponsford said.Clint Ponsford and his family have been overwhelmed after attending so many vigils and memorials. They hung a poster for Ms. Leiker amid the photos and flowers garlanding a security fence outside the shuttered King Soopers. It says, "We Will Always Miss You." Mr. Ponsford took a photo beside it, but he does not like to go back to the scene now.For almost two weeks, Colorado has also been grieving. The state is immersed in a now-familiar mourning ritual for mass shooting victims, where friends gather to share sweet stories and the governor imparts the state's condolences, again and again.Denny Stong, who dreamed of being a pilot, was memorialized last Thursday at an airport overlooking the Front Range of the Rockies. The next day, Lonna Bartkowiak's friends pinned purple flowers to their shirts and remembered her as a compassionate friend and mainstay of Boulder's festival scene. On Wednesday, Rikki Olds's friends and family celebrated her love of ketchup, ever-changing neon hair colors and the irrepressible joy she brought to her job as a front-of-store manager at King Soopers.Friday was Ms. Leiker's turn. From the University of Colorado's basketball court, friends, politicians and people who knew her from work or through programs for people with disabilities marveled at the impact a single courtesy clerk had on so many."Teri was the heartbeat of this community," Matthew Dockendorf, director of the university's marching band, said during the memorial.These are some things her family and friends wanted people to know: Ms. Leiker was a lifelong Coloradan who loved the mountains. She graduated from a special education program at Longmont High School and had lived independently since she was 21.She loved University of Colorado sports — especially women's hockey — and delighted in posing for photos with Chip the Buffalo, the university's mascot. She rocked a fanny pack almost everywhere she went. She belted "Let It Go" with abandon at karaoke bars."Everything was a happy moment for her," Lexi Knutson, one of her close friends, said in an interview. Ms. Knutson met Ms. Leiker a few years ago through the University of Colorado chapter of the Best Buddies program, which connects students with adults from around Boulder who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.Ms. Leiker started working at King Soopers 31 years ago, and her laughter and little catchphrases — "Oh, honestly!" — left a decades-long impression on co-workers and customers. She loved it whenever a shopper she knew arrived with a reusable Mickey Mouse bag. She did a happy dance when a friend swung by the store. She gave pennies to children to ride the mechanical horse.There were also hard things. Some childhood classmates had made fun of her, Ms. Leiker's mother, Margie Whittington, told The Boulder Daily Camera. Ms. Leiker cried for people uprooted by Colorado's floods and wildfires. She hated to see her friends upset, Ms. Knutson said."If you started crying, she'd shake her finger at you and be like, 'That's enough,'" she said.Her friends say they are trying to remember that admonition now. What to Know About Gun Laws and Shootings in the U.S.In the last five years, there have been at least 29 shootingsin the United States with four or more fatalities, according to data compiled by the Violence Project. The number of overall injuries from firearms reached a 50-year high in 2017, with nearly 40,000 people killed. Americans make up about 4.4 percent of the global population but own 42 percent of the world's guns. Research shows that 31 percent of mass shootings worldwide from 1966 to 2012 were committed by Americans.The Times examined how weapons were obtainedin 19 shootings from 2009 to 2018. Many of the guns used in mass shootings are bought legally and with a federal background check.At the state level, there is a checkerboard of gun laws that align with the partisan tilt of each state. While 13 Democratic-controlled states have restricted gun access in recent years, 14 Republican states have loosened their gun laws. She would hate to see the pain people are going through," said Katie Heinen, who also knew Ms. Leiker through the Best Buddies program.Mr. Ponsford said the pandemic was especially hard. So many of the college pep rallies and games Ms. Leiker had loved were canceled. A gala evening for King Soopers employees celebrating their 30-year anniversary was also called off. Mr. Ponsford would tell Ms. Leiker, We're going to get through this together."She'd say, 'Yeah, we have to,'" he said.Mr. Ponsford said they had both received their first coronavirus vaccination on St. Patrick's Day. They had hoped they could soon take a trip to Disney World or go to a Renaissance fair this summer.Five days later, midafternoon, March 22: Mr. Ponsford caught Ms. Leiker's eye near the end of his shift as he headed outside to collect stray shopping carts. He wanted her to come with him. He said she waved from her post bagging groceries and told him she would see him later.Mr. Ponsford said he saw the attack begin in the parking lot as he was pushing a line of carts toward the store. He said he watched as the gunman shot people down on the asphalt, then went into the store, right toward Ms. Leiker."I was scared," he said. "I was worried about my sweetheart."Mr. Ponsford ran for safety at a nearby pizza place and called his brother and Ms. Leiker's mother as the police swarmed in. He and her friends spent those first hours praying she had gotten out, that she was not answering calls because she had lost her phone in the chaos. Mr. Ponsford learned the reality early the next morning.After a few nights spent with family, Mr. Ponsford moved back into Ms. Leiker's condo. It is comforting, being surrounded by photos and memories of watching Broncos games together and cooking steaks and sitting out on the patio, but also hard, he said. Each night, he phones one of Ms. Leiker's close friends and checks in with Ms. Leiker's mother to say he got home safe — calls that she used to make."I'm kind of lost without her there," he said. "She's part of me."

Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, father of Prince Charles and patriarch of a turbulent royal family that he sought to ensure would not be Britain's last, died on Friday at Windsor Castle in England. He was 99. His death was announced by Buckingham Palace, which said he passed away peacefully.Philip had been hospitalized several times in recent years for various ailments, most recently in February, the palace said. Go here for updates and reaction to Prince Philip's death.He died just as Buckingham Palace was again in turmoil, this time over Oprah Winfrey's explosive televised interview last month with Philip's grandson Prince Harry and Harry's wife, Meghan. The couple, in self-imposed exile in California, lodged accusations of racism and cruelty against members of the royal family.As "the first gentleman in the land," Philip tried to shepherd into the 20th century a monarchy encrusted with the trappings of the 19th. But as pageantry was upstaged by scandal, as regal weddings were followed by sensational divorces, his mission, as he saw it, changed. Now it was to help preserve the crown itself.And yet preservation — of Britain, of the throne, of centuries of tradition — had always been the mission. When this tall, handsome prince married the young crown princess, Elizabeth, on Nov. 20, 1947 — he at 26, she at 21 — a battered Britain was still recovering from World War II, the sun had all but set on its empire, and the abdication of Edward VIII over his love for Wallis Simpson, a divorced American, was still reverberating a decade later.The wedding held out the promise that the monarchy, like the nation, would survive, and it offered that reassurance in almost fairy-tale fashion, complete with magnificent horse-drawn coaches resplendent in gold and a throng of adoring subjects lining the route between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.More, it was a heartfelt match. Elizabeth told her father, King George VI, that Philip was the only man she could ever love.Philip occupied a peculiar place on the world stage as the husband of a queen whose powers were largely ceremonial. He was essentially a second-fiddle figurehead, accompanying her on royal visits and sometimes standing in for her.And yet he embraced his royal role as a job to be done. "We have got to make this monarchy thing work," he was reported to have said.He kept at it until May 2017, when, at age 95, he announced his retirement from public life; his final solo appearance came three months later.But he did not entirely fade from public view. He surfaced in May 2018, when he joined the sun-splashed pomp of the wedding of Harry and Meghan, waving to crowds lining the streets from the back seat of a limousine, the queen beside him, and striding up the steps of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in a crisp morning suit.By then he had re-emerged as a kind of pop-culture figure, introduced to a whole new generation through the hit Netflix series "The Crown," a costume drama that has traced the events of postwar Britain through the prism of his buffeted royal marriage. (Matt Smith played the prince as a young man, and Tobias Menzies in middle age.)Public and Private FacesPhilip's public image often came dressed in full military regalia, an emblem of his high-ranking titles in the armed forces and a reminder of both his combat experience in World War II and his martial lineage: He was a nephew of the war leader Lord Mountbatten.Many saw Philip as a mostly remote if occasionally loose-lipped personage in public, given to riling constituents with off-the-cuff remarks that were called oblivious, insensitive or worse. To a Black British politician he was quoted as saying, "And what exotic part of the world do you come from?"As the years went by, word seeped out that Philip, in private, could be irascible and demanding, cold and domineering — and that as parents, he and an emotionally reserved queen brought little warmth into the household.Even more, as many Britons came to see the royal family as increasingly dysfunctional, they found Philip to be a not-insignificant actor in a state of affairs that had many questioning the very thing that he and Elizabeth had been elevated to ensure: the monarchy's stability.Philip had apparently not expected the type of public scrutiny that came with the times, when the washing of dirty linen, even the queen's, had become a staple of the tabloid press, which he grew to despise.No headlines were more boisterous than those during the tumultuous marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. But Philip himself felt the spotlight's unwelcome glare when the royal family was castigated for a seemingly grudging response to Britain's outpouring of grief over Diana's death in a car crash in Paris in 1997.Painful, too, for Philip was the revelation that Prince Charles, his oldest son, had let it be known that as a child he had been deeply wounded by a father who belittled him time and again, often in front of friends and family.A 1994 biography, "The Prince of Wales," by Jonathan Dimbleby with the cooperation of Prince Charles, noted that while Philip indulged "the often brash and obstreperous behavior" of his daughter, Princess Anne, he was openly contemptuous of his son, whom he thought of as "a bit of a wimp."Charles, for his part, "was cowed by his father," who he believed had forced him into a "terrible mismatch" with Diana, Mr. Dimbleby wrote.Though the glory he knew was largely of the reflected kind, Philip nevertheless enjoyed the privileges and prerogatives of the British crown, living in luxury, sailing yachts, playing polo and piloting planes. And he used his station to promote the common good, lending his name and time to causes like building playing fields for British youths and protecting endangered wildlife.Another was instituting efficiencies at Buckingham Palace, originally bought by his and Elizabeth's ancestor George III. Philip had intercoms installed, for example, to obviate the need for messengers.At home he showed — by palace standards, at any rate — a common touch. When the telephone rang, he answered it himself, setting a royal precedent. He even announced to the queen one day that he had bought her a washing machine. He reportedly mixed his own drinks, opened doors for himself and carried his own suitcase, telling the footmen: "I have arms. I'm not bloody helpless."He sent his children to school instead of having them tutored at home, as had been the royal custom. He set up a kitchen in the family suite, where he fried eggs for breakfast while the queen brewed tea — an attempt, it was said, to provide their children with some semblance of a normal domestic life.Prince Philip carried British passport No. 1 (the queen did not require one) and fulfilled as many as 300 engagements a year, including greeting President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, at Buckingham Palace in April 2009 and again in May 2011. (He was not in attendance when the queen met with President Donald J. Trump in December 2019 in London.) And he was front and center at royal events, like the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011, watched around the world, and Elizabeth's visit to the Irish Republic, the first by a British monarch, the next month.Philip was the first member of the royal family to go to the Soviet Union, representing the queen on a trip with the British equestrian team in 1973.To escape the court life, Philip liked to drive fast, often relegating his chauffeur to the back seat. Once, when the queen was his passenger, a minor accident led to major headlines. He ultimately surrendered his driver's license in 2019 at age 97, after his Land Rover collided with another vehicle, injuring its two occupants, and overturned near the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.He liked to pilot his own planes and once had a near miss with a passenger jet. He enjoyed sailing, but was said to have so little patience with horse racing that he had his top hat fitted with a radio so that he could listen to cricket matches when he escorted the queen to her favorite spectator sport.When he first came to public attention, his every colorful remark was noted. When a man introduced his wife as the Ph.D. in the family, saying, "She's much more important than I am," Philip replied, "We have the same problem in our family."Deep Roots in RoyaltyPhilip was born on the Greek island of Corfu on June 10, 1921, the fifth child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, who was the brother of King Constantine of Greece. His mother was the former Princess Alice, the oldest daughter of the former Prince Louis of Battenberg, the first Marquess of Milford Haven, who changed the family name to Mountbatten during World War I.Philip's family was not Greek but rather descended from a royal Danish house that the European powers had put on the throne of Greece in the 19th century. Philip, who never learned the Greek language, was sixth in line to the Greek throne.Through his mother, Philip was a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria, just as Elizabeth is Victoria's great-great-granddaughter. Both were great-great-great-great-grandchildren of George III, who presided over Britain's loss of the American colonies.A year after Philip was born, the army of King Constantine was overwhelmed by the Turks in Asia Minor, now part of Turkey. Prince Andrew, Philip's father, who had commanded an army corps in the routed Greek forces, was banished by a revolutionary Greek junta.In "Prince Philip: The Turbulent Early Life of the Man Who Married Queen Elizabeth II" (2011), the British writer Philip Eade reported that as an infant Philip was smuggled out of Greece in a fruit crate as his father, eluding execution, found refuge for his family in Paris, where they lived in straitened circumstances.Philip's father was said to have been an Anglophile. The boy's first language was English, taught to him by a British nanny. He grew to 6 feet 1 inch, his blue eyes and blond hair reflecting his Nordic ancestry.When his parents separated, Philip was sent to live with his mother's mother, the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. He spent four years at the Cheam School in England, an institution bent on toughening privileged children, and then went to Gordonstoun School in Scotland, which was even more austere, promoting a regimen of hard work, cold showers and hard beds. In five years, he said, no one from his family came to visit him.Even so, Philip sent Charles to both schools, to have him follow in his footsteps.At Gordonstoun, Philip developed a love of the sea, learning seamanship and boatbuilding as a volunteer coast guardsman at the school. He seemed destined to follow his Mountbatten uncles into the British Navy.While he was at Gordonstoun, in 1937, he learned that his pregnant sister Cecilie had died in a plane crash along with her two children and her husband, a German aristocrat and prominent Nazi Party member. Philip, at 16, traveled to Germany for the funeral and was photographed having to march alongside men in Nazi uniforms with whom he would soon be at war. (Three of his four older sisters had married into the German aristocracy, and another of their husbands became an SS officer. His surviving sisters were later not invited to his wedding to Elizabeth.)Philip entered the Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in 1939 and was honored as the best all-around cadet of his term. The next year, with Britain at war, the 19-year-old Philip went to sea as a sublieutenant aboard the battleship Ramillies in the Mediterranean fleet. He was later transferred to the Valiant, another battleship.On March 28, 1941, the British fleet caught an Italian squadron off Cape Matapan in Greece and, with the Royal Air Force's help, sank three cruisers and two destroyers. Philip participated in the clash, operating a searchlight. "Thanks to his alertness and appreciation of the situation," his captain wrote, "we were able to sink two eight-inch-gun Italian cruisers."Philip was promoted to lieutenant in June 1942 and took part in the Allied landings in Sicily in July 1943 before sailing for the Pacific campaign. There he served as aide-de-camp to his uncle Louis, Lord Mountbatten, who was then the supreme allied commander in Southeast Asia; Philip was on the United States battleship Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945, when the Japanese formally surrendered. (Lord Mountbatten was killed in a bombing by the Irish Republican Army in 1979.)Where or when Philip first met Princess Elizabeth remains unclear, but it seems certain that he was invited to dine on the royal yacht when Elizabeth was 13 or 14, and that he was also invited to stay at Windsor Castle around that time while on leave from the Navy. There were reports that he had visited the royal family at Balmoral, its country estate in Scotland, and that by the time the weekend was over, Elizabeth had made up her mind, telling her father that this dashing young naval officer was "the only man I could ever love."George VI had doubts. He took her to South Africa on a royal tour, cautioned her to be patient and wrote to his own mother, Queen Mary."We both think that she is too young for that now, as she has never met any young men of her own age," George wrote. But he added: "I like Philip. He is intelligent, has a good sense of humor" and "thinks about things in the right way."Elizabeth was said to have written to Philip three times a week while she toured South Africa. By the time she returned to England, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark had renounced his foreign titles and become Lt. Philip Mountbatten, a British subject. The gesture pleased his future father-in-law. The engagement was announced on July 10, 1947.Articles about the coming marriage pushed reports of food and coal shortages off the front pages. Sales assistants sent ration coupons to the princess (even the royal family was living within limits) so she could have new dresses. The House of Commons approved 100 extra clothing coupons for her. On the eve of the wedding, in 1947, Lieutenant Mountbatten was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron of Greenwich, and given the title His Royal Highness.The 'First Gentleman'A year later, on Nov. 14, 1948, Elizabeth gave birth to the couple's first child, Charles Philip Arthur George, at Buckingham Palace. Charles was followed by Princess Anne, in 1950; Prince Andrew, in 1960, after Elizabeth had become queen; and Prince Edward, in 1964. In addition to the queen and his four children, Prince Philip is survived by eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. After his marriage, Prince Philip took command of the frigate Magpie in Malta. But King George VI had lung cancer, and when his condition worsened, it was announced that Philip would take no more naval appointments. In 1952, the young couple had reached Kenya, their first stop on a commonwealth tour, when word arrived on Feb. 6 that the king was dead.It fell to Philip to break the news to his wife.Philip presided over the Coronation Commission, and in 1952 the new queen ordained that he should be "first gentleman in the land," giving him "a place of pre-eminence and precedence next to Her Majesty." Without this distinction, Prince Charles, who was named Duke of Cornwall and later Prince of Wales — the title traditionally given to the heir to the throne — would have ranked above his father.Philip was appointed to the highest ranks in the armed services: admiral of the fleet, field marshal and marshal of the Royal Air Force. He held the posts without pay.Four years later, in 1956, Philip, then 35, took a four-month, 36,000-mile sea tour. Ostensibly he was on his way to Melbourne, Australia, for the opening of the Olympic Games, but the trip followed reports of his carousing with friends at bachelor parties in London.On his return, the queen gave Philip the title Prince of the United Kingdom. By royal warrant, Elizabeth brought her husband's name into the royal line, ordering that their children, except for Prince Charles, be known as Mountbatten-Windsor.There were rumors of trouble in the marriage, reports of raised voices in the palace corridors. But the marital difficulties of their children overshadowed any discord between the parents. Princess Anne was divorced from her first husband, Mark Phillips, in 1992, and Prince Andrew's divorce in 1996 from Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who was known as Fergie, provided a field day for the tabloids.But those divorces paled beside the travails of Charles and Diana. And Philip, a vigilant guardian of royal propriety (he once complained that Henry VIII, whom he called a "wonderful military strategist," was remembered solely for his six wives), was not a silent bystander in the melodrama. According to Andrew Morton, in his book "Diana: Her True Story," written with Diana's cooperation, Charles told her that his father "had agreed that if, after five years, his marriage was not working, he could go back to his bachelor habits."Once their differences had become public, however, Philip registered his disapproval of Diana by snubbing her at the Royal Ascot horse race. And after Diana, at 36, was killed in 1997, Philip came in for his share of criticism when the royal family remained out of view at Balmoral, seemingly out of touch with the public's grief, an attitude portrayed as stubborn and cold in the 2006 film "The Queen," in which James Cromwell played Philip to Helen Mirren's Elizabeth.Over the years, Philip became a national gadfly and occasional source of embarrassment. In 1961 he criticized British industry as a bastion for "the smug and the stick-in-the-mud," calling failures in manufacturing and commerce "a national defeat." He was said to write his own speeches, and his habit of saying what he thought made him good copy.In 1995 he asked a Scottish driving instructor, "How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?" On a visit to Australia in 2002, he asked an aboriginal leader, "Do you still throw spears at each other?" And speaking about smoke alarms in 1998 to a woman who had lost two sons in a fire, he said: "They're a damn nuisance. I've got one in my bathroom, and every time I run my bath, the steam sets it off."The comments invited scorn. "I know all about freedom of speech," he told some students, "because I get kicked in the teeth often enough for saying things."Philip was a sportsman. He was captain and mainstay of the Windsor Park polo team. When he turned 50, troubled by arthritis and liver problems, he curtailed his playing and turned to carriage racing. He also started painting.In an interview on BBC Radio in 1965, Philip recognized that he was missing out on things like "just being able to walk into a cinema or go out to a nightclub or go to a pub." But he quickly acknowledged the bright side."I've got a lot of advantages which compensate for it," he said.

As they mourned the death of Prince Philip, who through 73 years of marriage to Queen Elizabeth II helped preserve a monarchy that many people saw as out of place in the modern world, the royal family and the nation grappled with how to pay him final honors amid a pandemic when mass gatherings are prohibited.Tributes and condolences poured in from around Britain and the world, and small crowds collected outside Windsor Castle, where the 99-year-old prince died, and outside Buckingham Palace in London, despite rules barring outdoor gatherings of more than six people. Many of those gathered laid bouquets at the perimeter gates.Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, will not lie in state for public viewing. His funeral will be held at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, rather than a much larger and more public venue like Westminster Abbey in London, and because of the pandemic it will not be open to the public. More details are expected to be released on Saturday.His death follows a traumatic 13 months in which Covid-19 has killed more than 150,000 Britons — by far the highest official toll in Europe — and social distancing requirements have deprived millions of survivors of the usual commemorations. Now it is the nation's most prominent family dealing with the same issue. Britain currently allows no more than 30 people to attend a funeral.The subdued treatment of Philip's death reflects not only the times but also the prince, who occasionally relished deflating the stuffy pomp surrounding the monarchy — as well as the self-important airs of others — and indicated that he did not see himself as being significant except as an extension of his wife.His penchant for insulting and bigoted comments, and the image of him as a cold father, made Philip a somewhat problematic public figure for the queen, now 94, and the royal family. But by the 1990s his controversies were overshadowed by those of his children, and his advancing age made his sharp tongue charming to many people, or simply more irrelevant than offensive.The prince's devotion to the queen throughout the longest marriage in British royal history, despite some rocky times early on, and to sustaining and modernizing the monarchy improved his popularity, as did his dogged adherence to a schedule of charity events, ribbon-cuttings and travel well into his 90s. He received an assist from the popular series "The Crown," which has depicted him as maturing into a wise and dedicated, if emotionally distant, figure.Again and again, people paying tribute on Wednesday cited Philip's commitment to duty."I just have so much respect for Prince Philip and all he's done," Britta Bia, 53 said outside Buckingham Palace, headquarters of the royal household. "I have so much respect for the royal family. I think they've done so much for charitable causes, and I think they've been upstanding citizens of the commonwealth."Philip served in the Royal Navy and saw combat during World War II, "and from that conflict, he took an ethic of service that he applied throughout the unprecedented changes of the postwar era," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said outside No. 10 Downing Street.In a statement, President Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, said: "The impact of his decades of devoted public service is evident in the worthy causes he lifted up as patron, in the environmental efforts he championed, in the members of the armed forces that he supported, in the young people he inspired, and so much more."Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited the prince's "straightforwardness and his sense of duty."Last month, the royal family endured an unusually painful and public airing of its internal tensions, as Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gave an interview to Oprah Winfrey, explaining their clashes within the palace and their decision to move to California. Philip, Harry's paternal grandfather, was not mentioned as a factor, but defenders of the royals attacked the young couple for adding strain to the family at a time when Philip was hospitalized and appeared to be in failing health.The decision not to give Philip a state funeral and have him lie in state is in accordance with his wishes, according to the College of Arms, a part of the royal household that helps organize state occasions. The last consort of a monarch who died, Queen Mary, mother of Queen Elizabeth and widow of King George VI, did lie in state after her death in 2002."It is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral," the College of Arms said in a statement.The palace said Philip had died peacefully and did not cite a specific cause, but said he did not have the coronavirus. He had been hospitalized several times over the past decade, including once for treatment of a blocked coronary artery and, in increasingly frail condition, he had stepped back from public duties in 2017.This year, he was hospitalized for four weeks, and underwent surgery on March 3 for what the palace described only as a pre-existing heart condition. He was also treated for an unspecified infection. He was released on March 16, just 24 days before his death.Elian Peltier, Stephen Castle, Derrick Bryson Taylor, Geneva Abdul, Alex Marshall and Daniel Victor contributed reporting.

Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II and the longest-serving consort in British history, was born into Greek royalty in the 1920s, served on a battleship in World War II, toured the world on royal missions for decades and sought for most of his life to defend the interests of Britain's monarchy.His life spanned almost a century of upheaval and change for Britain: As a child, he lived with a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and he died nearly 100 years old, survived by great grandchildren who will grow up in an era of smartphones and the internet.Philip came to England after his father, Prince Andrew of Greece, was banished by a revolutionary Greek junta. He was educated at the Cheam School, an institution bent on toughening privileged children, and then went to Gordonstoun School in Scotland, which promoted a regimen of grueling work, cold showers and hard beds.He met Princess Elizabeth when she was about 13 or 14. She was instantly smitten, telling her father, King George VI, that she could love no other man but him. They married on Nov. 20, 1947, when he was 26 and she was 21.Philip embraced his royal duties, accompanying the queen on visits and sometimes standing in for her — apparently content to play second-fiddle while enjoying the privileges of the crown, sailing yachts, playing polo and piloting planes.Yet, he had a more common touch. He carried his own suitcases, fried eggs while the queen brewed tea, and sent his children to school, instead of continuing the royal tradition of educating them at home.He was also a staunch defender of the environment, warning about greenhouse gases and lending his time to causes like protecting endangered wildlife.But he grew to hate the relentless tabloid coverage of palace affairs. The public often perceived him as a remote if occasionally loose-lipped figure who made remarks that were called oblivious, insensitive or worse.He was pained by the headlines that followed the tumultuous marriage and divorce of his eldest son, Prince Charles, and Lady Diana Spencer. He became known as a stern and even imperious figure in the royal family who belittled Charles, and he and the family were castigated by the public for their response to the death of Diana.Philip died as Buckingham Palace was embroiled in turmoil over Oprah Winfrey's televised interview last month with his grandson Prince Harry and Harry's wife, Meghan.Here is his life in pictures:Philip on his ninth birthday, in Greek dress.Philip, second from left, at the MacJannet American School in St. Cloud, France.Philip and Elizabeth, then a princess, after their wedding ceremony on Nov. 20, 1947.The couple in the grounds of Broadlands in Hampshire, where they spent their honeymoon, in 1947.Elizabeth and Philip with their children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, at Clarence House, in 1951.The queen and prince in Boston in 1975.Philip flying a Blackburn military transport plane a few minutes before a fire extinguisher burst in 1956.

Even when DMX was the most popular rapper on the planet, he was a genre of one: a gruff, motivational, agitated and poignant fire-starter. Pure vigor and pure heart. A drill sergeant and a healer.In 1998 and 1999, he released three majestic, bombastic albums: "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot," "Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood" and "… And Then There Was X." Each one debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and has been certified platinum several times over. He performed at Woodstock '99 for hundreds of thousands of people. He starred in "Belly," the seminal 1998 hip-hop noir film. In his songs, he growled like a dog, credibly and often.And yet there were no DMX clones in his wake because there was no way to falsify the life that forged him. For DMX — who died Friday at 50 after suffering a heart attack on April 2 — hip-hop superstardom came on the heels of a devastating childhood marked by abuse, drug use, crime and other traumas. His successes felt more like catharsis than triumphalism. Even at his rowdiest and most celebrated, he was a vessel for profound pain.Especially as he got older, and his public struggles — countless arrests, stints in jail, continuing problems with drugs — threatened to overshadow his musical legacy, he never hid his hurt, never let shame overshadow his truth. The potency of his humanity was as heroic as any of his songs.From the release of his debut Def Jam single, "Get at Me Dog," in 1998, DMX was an immediate titanic presence in hip-hop. Just as the genre was moving toward polished sheen, he preferred iron and concrete — rapping with a muscular throatiness that conveyed an excitable kind of mayhem. The staccato bursts on "Ruff Ryders' Anthem" — an early Swizz Beatz masterpiece — matched DMX's jabs of melancholy: "All I know is pain/All I feel is rain."His voice was unrelentingly coarse, and in his peak era, between 1998 and 2003, he used it for one chest-puffed anthem after another: "Party Up (Up in Here)," "What's My Name?," "Who We Be," "X Gon' Give It to Ya," "Where the Hood At?" Often, he rapped as if he were trying to win an argument, with repetitive emphasis and terse phrasing designed for maximum impact. Even when he dipped into flirtation, like on "What These Bitches Want," he didn't change his approach.But when he took on his own troubled past on "Slippin'," he tempered himself just a bit, as if showing himself some grace:They put me in a situation forcing me to be a manWhen I was just learning to stand without a helping hand, damnWas it my fault, something I didTo make a father leave his first kid? At 7 doing my first bidEven though DMX's time at the top of the genre was relatively brief, just a few ferocious years, he was never erased from its collective memory. That's partly because the tumult of his personal life constantly landed him in the spotlight — he was arrested dozens of times, for charges including drug possession, aggravated assault, driving without a license and tax evasion. He rescued stray dogs, and tattooed a tribute to one of his dogs, Boomer, across the whole of his back, but also pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges.But he remained a subject of sympathy: DMX was a wild man, and a broken one, too. Physically abused by his mother as a child, he spent significant stretches of time in group homes. He took to crime young, specializing in robbery. Many of the stories contained in his 2002 book, "E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX," are matter of fact and harrowing.In a devastating interview last year, he explained that the person who first encouraged him to rap was also the one who first exposed him to crack, forever intertwining the art that was his salvation with the addiction that constantly threatened to undo him.DMX's life became a tug of war between his musical gift and his traumas. Beginning in the mid-2000s, he began to fade from the charts. His turns on the big screen, in "Belly," "Romeo Must Die" and "Exit Wounds," gave way to turns on sometimes voyeuristic reality television programs like "Couples Therapy," "Dr. Drew's Lifechangers" and "Iyanla: Fix My Life." His search for healing — his need for it — became central to his public narrative.DMX HAD ALREADY learned to tame arenas on the Hard Knock Life and Survival of the Illest tours by the time I first saw him live, in 2000, on the Cash Money/Ruff Ryders tour. It was as jolting as any performance I've ever seen — a frantic yet controlled display of raw charisma and might. Toward the end of his set, he stopped cold to offer a prayer. His body was covered in sweat, his voice was gruff, and thousands of people in the room went from boisterous to silent, sideswiped by DMX's gospel. I saw the tour again a few weeks later — the scene was no less vivid.He'd been doing this for a while by then, startling audiences with his religious fervor. "It damn near brings me to tears every night because I get nothing but love. It's like I'm taking them to church," he told the Source in 1999. "I just love 'em to death. I can't even explain it. Just seeing them look at me the way they do. I can't help but to love them. And I'm not going to take them to the wrong place."Every time I've seen DMX in the two decades since — from a tiny comeback show at S.O.B.'s in New York to an Easter Sunday convocation with Kanye West at Coachella — he did a version of the prayer, bringing a conflagration of a performance to a halt. On the surface, it seemed like a gift, a way to spread a message about mercy and hope in the unlikeliest of settings. But in those moments, he was also a supplicant laid bare — praying for us, and asking all of us to cover him in return.

Earl Simmons, the snarling yet soulful rapper known as DMX, who had a string of No. 1 albums in the late 1990s and early 2000s but whose personal struggles eventually rivaled his lyrical prowess, died on Friday in White Plains, N.Y. He was 50.His family announced the death in a statement. He had been on life support at White Plains Hospital after suffering what his family called "a catastrophic cardiac arrest" a week earlier."Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end," the Simmons family said. "He loved his family with all of his heart, and we cherish the times we spent with him."On April 2, Mr. Simmons had a heart attack at his home in White Plains. In the days that followed, his representatives said he was on life support "in a vegetative state." Outside of the hospital, family and friends gathered with hundreds of fans, playing DMX's music aloud and praying, holding up their arms in the shape of an X.Mr. Simmons's music was often menacing and dark, with the occasional nod to Christian spirituality. He committed crimes, served time in different correctional institutions and battled addiction long before he released an album, and his troubled past informed the gritty content and inimitable delivery of his rhymes.He barked over the chorus of "Get at Me Dog," the breakout single from his 1998 debut album, "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot.""His throat seems to hold a fuzzbox and a foghorn, and between songs he growled and barked," Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote of a Simmons concert performance in 2000. "In his raps, the gangsta life is a living hell, a constant test of loyalty and resolve."He rapped with an explosive cadence on "Party Up (Up in Here)," the big hit from his 1999 album " … And Then There Was X"; raw braggadocio on "Ruff Ryders' Anthem," a tribute to his record label on his 1998 debut album, "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot"; and a more introspective, brooding delivery on "Damien," a story about making a murderous bargain with a demonic benefactor."Why is it every move I make turns out to be a bad one?" Mr. Simmons asks in "Damien." "Where's my guardian angel? Need one, wish I had one."Mr. Simmons, who sold millions of records and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, was the first musician whose first five albums reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. He was the standout artist on the Ruff Ryders label, often rapping over tracks by the star D.J. and producer Swizz Beatz. Rappers like Eve, Drag-On and the Lox, a group made up of Jadakiss, Styles P and Sheek Louch, also recorded on the label.Mr. Simmons was known for electrifying concert audiences. In 2000, the critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times about his "remarkable and combative stage presence" in the concert documentary "Backstage," which followed him and rappers like Jay-Z and Redman on the 1999 "Hard Knock Life" tour."Bombastic and hot-blooded, he holds court in a singular fashion, exercising sheer force of will to pull the spotlight down on himself and demanding the crowd's attention," Mr. Mitchell wrote.Mr. Simmons starred with the rappers Nas and Method Man in Hype Williams's 1998 gangster film, "Belly"; appeared in the 2000 action movie "Romeo Must Die" with Jet Li and the R&B singer Aaliyah; and starred with Steven Seagal in the 2001 action film "Exit Wounds." The BET cable channel provided a closer look at his personal life with the 2006 reality series "DMX: Soul of a Man."The macho, streetwise persona Mr. Simmons projected in his music was reinforced by repeated arrests on charges including fraud, assault, weapons possession, narcotics possession and driving under the influence.He served jail time after pleading guilty in 2008 to animal cruelty, drug possession and theft; in 2018 he was sentenced to a year in prison for tax evasion.He released several more albums over the years, including "Grand Champ" (2003) and "Undisputed" (2012). But with his frequent run-ins with the law, he never regained the success of his earlier days.Born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., on Dec. 18, 1970, Earl Simmons was the first and only child of Arnett Simmons and Joe Barker. He grew up in Yonkers, a city just north of the Bronx that became a hotbed of racial tension in the 1980s.His father was an itinerant artist whom he rarely saw, and his mother struggled to raise him and his half sister Bonita in a violent neighborhood. In his memoir, "E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX" (2002, with Smokey D. Fontaine), he wrote that there was often little food at home while he was growing up and that as a precocious, hot-tempered and disobedient child, he was often beaten by his mother and her lovers. (Information on his survivors was not immediately available.)Mr. Simmons turned to street crime as he grew older, spending much of his childhood and teenage years in group homes or juvenile detention facilities, where, he wrote, he sometimes faced solitary confinement. He became an adept car thief and robber, he said, often using vicious dogs to intimidate victims."I was straight stickup," Mr. Simmons wrote. "I'd rob three times a day: before school, after school and on the late night."In the late 1980s he started performing as a beatboxer, creating beats using only his mouth, with a local rapper named Ready Ron. (He took the name DMX from the Oberheim DMX drum machine, a model popular in the 1980s.) He said he was 14 when Ready Ron introduced him to crack cocaine by passing him what Mr. Simmons thought was marijuana."I later found out that he laced the blunt with crack," Mr. Simmons told the rapper Talib Kweli in an interview last year. "Why would you do that to a child?" He became addicted to it.His long struggle with drugs, his bleak childhood and their impact on his life informed his music — he titled a 2001 album "The Great Depression" — and many of his most swaggering songs conveyed hints of lingering trauma."All I know is pain/All I feel is rain/How can I maintain?" he raps near the start of "Ruff Ryders' Anthem."In 1997 he was featured, along with Method Man, Redman, Master P and Canibus, on the LL Cool J song "4, 3, 2, 1." He was also on Mase's "24 Hrs. to Live" and, with Lil' Kim, the Lox's "Money, Power, Respect." Those high-profile guest appearances led to a contract with Def Jam, Ruff Ryders' parent company; his first two albums came out in 1998.Before breaking through as a rap star, Mr. Simmons made a name for himself as a nasty battle rapper in the early 1990s."I always made it personal," he wrote in his memoir. "Nothing was too rude or vicious for me because I didn't care."Joe Coscarelli contributed reporting.

Earl Simmons, the gruff, evocative rapper from Yonkers, N.Y., better known as DMX, died on Friday at 50. He spent his final days on life support at White Plains Hospital in Westchester County after suffering a heart attack on April 2.DMX was one of the most recognizable M.C.s in the late 1990s and early 2000s, years when hardcore New York rap could still stake a claim as hip-hop's central concern.Signed to Def Jam Recordings, his first five albums all debuted at No. 1, a feat no rapper has matched before or since. DMX cut a unique figure for a superstar rapper: He'd battle his inner demons using the horror-centric imagery beloved by heavy metal bands, but his albums reliably offered heartfelt, often a cappella, prayers to God. He made giant pop crossover hits, but they bubbled with wildly vivid threats better suited for a grindhouse theater. His shout-rap energy made him a favorite in the outwardly angsty era of Woodstock '99 and the nü-metal band Korn's Family Values Tour, but he was also a shirtless sex symbol moonlighting as an actor.Here's a small sampling of an artist with a range that encompassed the shocking, the sincere and the simply incredible. (Listen on Spotify here.)'Born Loser' (1993)After years spent as a ruthless battle rapper, mixtape hustler and early beneficiary of The Source magazine's Unsigned Hype column, DMX and the nascent Ruff Ryders label released the rarely heard "Born Loser" on a handful of 12-inch records. Soon after, "Born Loser" became the lone song released as part of DMX's false start with Columbia Records. Both DMX and the rapper K-Solo had claimed a rhyme style where individual words in bars are spelled out. For example, on his 1990 hit "Spellbound," K-Solo raps "I s-p-e-l-l very w-e-l-l/I only spell so all can t-e-l-l." After the success of "Spellbound," DMX wrote this track while fuming in a Westchester prison cell. "Born Loser" was not a hit, but as a punchline rap where DMX makes himself the punchline, it would foreshadow the self-eviscerating rhymes of rappers like Eminem and Fatlip: "They kicked me out the shelter because they said I smelled a/Little like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter."LL Cool J featuring Redman, Method Man, Canibus and DMX, '4, 3, 2, 1' (1997)This single would be epochal for multiple reasons. It sparked the lyrical war between LL Cool J and Canibus, perhaps the last consequential wax battle held on actual vinyl — soon such things were fought in the fields of mixtapes and MP3s. And "4, 3, 2, 1" was the breakout single for DMX, then a new Def Jam signee, who holds his own against members of an elite tier of M.C.s. Here, he raps death threats with a filmmaker's eye for detail: "Believe what I say when I tell you/Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody can smell you."DMX featuring Sheek Louch, 'Get at Me Dog' (1998)DMX recorded his debut Def Jam solo single amid the era of '80s pop samples, big-budget videos and a general sentiment of getting "jiggy." "I wasn't down with all that pretty, happy-go-lucky [expletive]," DMX said in "E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX." He added that Sean "Puffy" Combs "had the radio on lock, the clubs on fire, had people thinking that hip-hop was all about bright lights and shiny suits and smiled all the way to the bank — X, on the other hand, still lived in the dark." "Get at Me Dog" is pure, unfiltered rhyming over a loop of the disco-funk band B.T. Express. If it sounds like a mixtape rap, that's how it started: The beat and hook were part of a freestyle for DJ Clue. The song not only introduced DMX the solo artist, but introduced his trademark barking and growling, sounds inspired by his beloved pitbulls. The video — a black-and-white affair directed by Hype Williams — was filmed at New York's hip-hop meeting ground the Tunnel, where Funkmaster Flex held court on Sunday nights. The song became one of the most beloved "Tunnel bangers."'Ruff Ryders' Anthem' (1998)The third single from DMX's debut album, "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot," gleamed a little brighter than its predecessors. His rhymes were no less uncompromising and violent — "Had it, shoulda shot it/Now you're dearly departed," he raps. But the song heralded the blipping, pixelated debut of the producer Swizz Beatz, whose sound would ultimately define the next few years of the Ruff Ryders orbit: DMX, Eve, the Lox, Drag-On and Swizz Beatz's own solo work. Swizz Beatz told Vibe it took a week to convince DMX to do the song: "He was like, 'I don't want those white-boy beats.'" Swizz would go on to produce Top 10 singles for Beyoncé, Lil Wayne, T.I. and Busta Rhymes, and to co-found the popular quarantine-era streaming battle Verzuz.'Damien' (1998)The rapper's most famous storytelling rhyme involves him having a conversation with the devil — a play about fighting his own temptations. "At the time, X was in a really dark place as he was in and out of jail," the producer Dame Grease told Okayplayer. "He told me he thought he was in hell, mentally, and could hear the devil speaking to him. He wanted to find a way to recreate that feeling." Two sequels followed, including "The Omen (Damien II)," also in 1998, which featured a guest appearance from the shock-rocker Marilyn Manson, who would go on to have a notable impact on hip-hop, influencing modern goth-tinged artists like Travis Scott and Lil Uzi Vert, among others. The second sequel is "Damien III" (2001).'Slippin'' (1998)On this bloodletting, emotionally raw track, DMX confronts his troubled upbringing, his time in various institutions and his addictions with a sober eye. It was a personal and vulnerable look at his life and his struggles in the vein of diarist rappers like Tupac Shakur and Scarface. "X was writing 'Slippin'' for a while — six months, a year," the Ruff Ryders founder Joaquin "Waah" Dean told The Fader. "He wanted this song to be impacting people's lives."'Party Up (Up in Here)' (2000)Perhaps the most indelible DMX song, "Party Up (Up in Here)" has a chantable, giddy chorus that belies the nimble, severe trash talk in the verses. ("Listen, your ass is about to be missin'/You know who gon' find you? Some old man fishin'.") "It's called 'Party Up,' but it's very disrespectful," DMX told GQ, adding, "The beat is for the club, I just spit some real [expletive] to it." The durable track has had a long life thanks to its use in movies like "Gone in 60 Seconds" and TV shows like "The Mindy Project." Earl Simmons even has a writing credit in the era-defining musical "Hamilton" because of an interpolation used in "Meet Me Inside," a song that details a conversation between Alexander Hamilton and George Washington.Aaliyah featuring DMX, 'Come Back in One Piece' (2000)The 2000 film "Romeo Must Die" was the first film for the R&B superstar Aaliyah and the second for DMX. Though they do not play love interests in the movie, they did team up for this song from the soundtrack, a tune in the mold of hip-hop-soul duets like Method Man and Mary J. Blige's "I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By." However, it is almost like DMX refuses to meet R&B halfway: He rhymes an unapologetic full-throated street narrative while Aaliyah plays a beleaguered partner who just wants him to be safe.'Who We Be' (2001)"Who We Be" is a plain-spoken list of ills both political and personal, delivered with the thudding fire of an AC/DC song. It was the third and final DMX song to be nominated for a Grammy, but he never ended up taking one home.'X Gon' Give It to Ya' (2003)Though it was a moderate hit when released as a single from the "Cradle 2 the Grave" soundtrack in 2003, "X Gon' Give It to Ya" has ultimately emerged as the most popular DMX song of the streaming era thanks to its use in the "Deadpool" films and on television's "Rick and Morty." DMX intended it for his fifth album, "Grand Champ," but, seeing its potential, the "Cradle 2 the Grave" producer Joel Silver intervened. It was certified platinum in 2017, nearly 15 years after its release.

CLEMENTON, N.J. — Their coats buttoned against the chill of a gray Friday in March, people were climbing the stairs of the water slides and the roller coaster with clipboards and measuring tapes. They ducked under the carousel's turnstile to peer around its striped canvas cover, wind tattered and hanging to the ground in places, and walked the edge of a murky wave pool.It was three days before the auction of Clementon Park and Splash World, and a few dozen prospective bidders carried stapled packets listing 410 lots, from the Scrambler to the trash cans.Marianna Wilson, 60, had flown in from Cleburne, Texas. She walked along the railroad line, counting sections of track to estimate its total length. She and her husband, Jim Wilson, hoped it might fit on their farm park 25 miles south of Fort Worth. Mr. Wilson, 64, had his eye on the giant Ferris wheel.For most of its 114 years, the park was the largest taxpayer — and the principal attraction — of Clementon, a hamlet 20 minutes from Philadelphia. In September 2019, a week before the last scheduled day of the season, and rather presciently, considering the year to come, it closed without warning. Throughout the pandemic it has sat in an eerie limbo; in hurriedly abandoned offices and maintenance buildings, dust gathering on jackets slung over chair backs and to-do lists pinned to corkboards.Early this year, the park's corporate owners defaulted on a multi-million-dollar mortgage, and the auction was announced. Clementon Park, like so many small-town amusement parks before it, appeared doomed. Carnival proprietors, summer camp operators, ice cream shop owners and eccentric collectors came to the pre-auction inspection, looking to pick what they could from its bones.I was there too. I hadn't been inside for close to 15 years, but I grew up in Clementon, on a hill above the park. My bedroom windows faced the Ferris wheel; on summer nights its lights played across my ceiling. Its Jack Rabbit roller coaster was the first I ever rode. It took all season to work up the nerve, but eventually I climbed in next to my father, who swears the only seat on a coaster is the very front.In middle school, wielding season passes, my friends and I spent nearly every day in the park, floating around the lazy river until the sun dipped low, scarfing funnel cakes and playing endless rounds of Skee-Ball. We didn't have cellphones then. Instead, I toted a walkie-talkie, its pair at home with my mom. Every three hours I'd take a mandatory spin on the Ferris wheel — the signal only carried from the very top — to check in.In hindsight, I realize, it was a parent's dream. We were entertained, sufficiently supervised, and safe behind the park gates. But it felt like freedom. We were the luckiest kids in America, in a place that made us feel like we'd be young forever. Somehow, in the intervening years, it was the park that grew old. Now it was facing extinction.'Another Way of Life'In the early years of the 20th century, business at Theodore B. Gibbs's grist mill was suffering. Modern roller mills had rendered his operation on Clementon Lake obsolete, and Mr. Gibbs, a Civil War veteran who had served as Clementon's postmaster and the county sheriff, was looking for a new business venture.Ringed by fine sand and shady pines, Clementon Lake appealed to visitors from nearby farming communities and the rapidly growing city of Camden. Mr. Gibbs advertised a fleet of rowboats for rent and added a picnic building and a dance hall.In 1907, the public trolley line from Camden's Federal Street Ferry House was extended to the gates of Clementon Park, and visitors from Camden and Philadelphia flooded in."It was really the transportation industry that started the American amusement park," said Jim Futrell, the director and historian of the National Amusement Park Historical Association. Electric streetcar systems were invented in 1888. "Overnight, hundreds of trolley companies sprang up around the country, and they all decided to build resorts at the end of the line to generate traffic on evenings and weekends."Mr. Futrell estimates there were more than 1,000 trolley parks in the United States in the decade before the first world war, many of them in small suburban towns. In those boom years, Clementon Park added one of the region's first nickelodeon movie theaters and a new bathhouse. Vacation homes and restaurants sprung up throughout town.The war was tough on the amusement industry, but as trolley parks closed elsewhere, this one grew. In 1919, the Gibbs family installed a Ferris wheel and a steam-driven carousel. That same year, they spent $80,000 — more than $1 million today — for the Jack Rabbit coaster, designed by the renowned ride engineer John A. Miller and built of wood by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The Depression and the automobile's increasing popularity brought another wave of park closures. "You could survive if you had room to install a parking lot," Mr. Futrell said, "and Clementon did."More modern thrill rides were added. In the dance hall, Red Skelton and Dick Clark hosted dance-till-you-drop marathons. There were daily high-dive shows and circus acts on the lake. Just outside the park gates, a downtown shopping district bustled through the midcentury, and by 1960, Clementon's population had grown to nearly 4,000 residents in just two square miles.But the boom that followed World War II threatened the small-town way of life."They built huge malls and shopping centers just down the road," Danielle Burrows said, "and there was a hard shift away from downtown districts in the 1960s." Ms. Burrows, 41, grew up in town and wrote about Clementon for the "Images of America" book series in 2009. By the time the main street's shops and apartments were demolished in the name of "urban renewal" in the 1970s, Ms. Burrows said, "the town's heyday was at least a decade in the rearview."There are few stores and restaurants left now, and almost nothing is manufactured in Clementon today. When the amusement park didn't open at all during the 2020 season, Marian Mumie, 82, who was born in Clementon in 1938, recalled that earlier demolition."We're potentially on track for urban renewal Part 2," she said. "It's another way of life that's going for us."End of the RideLike little Alvy in "Annie Hall," many children of Clementon, including me, were indelibly imprinted by the lights and ambient noise of the park at the center of town."What I remember most is the sounds — the inclement weather announcements, the 'lost child' announcements, the screams from the roller coaster," Ms. Burrows said. "When they had the big cat show, I could hear them roaring at night when it got dark. The park was the soundtrack of our day-to-day."In the 1940s, Mrs. Mumie recalled, a bugle would announce the daily 4 p.m. circus act. "It was our signal to get out of the lake and go home for dinner," she said. "Every mother in town could hear that bugle; you couldn't be late."In 1977, after four generations of ownership, the Gibbs family sold the park to Abe Baker, a Miami nightclub owner, and his son, Larry. It was profitable for much of the next 30 years, though pieces began to slip away.In 1990, many of the hand-carved carousel horses were auctioned off to fund construction of the water park. In 1998, operator error derailed the Jack Rabbit, injuring three riders. It reopened briefly, but was shut down again over safety concerns in 2002 and was demolished, with little fuss, in 2007. The Baker family sold the park that year, to Adrenaline Family Entertainment Inc. (now defunct), who in turn sold to Premier Parks, in 2011."There were rising costs, rising land values, and investment bankers were becoming a force in the industry," Mr. Futrell said. The surviving small parks around the country "passed to a whole series of what I call the 'hedge fund owners.' The companies who run parks as investment vehicles, not their cherished family heirlooms. In Clementon's case, part of the problem was not knowing what they wanted to be. A park with a history like Clementon's should be a destination for enthusiasts, and it almost never comes up in conversation."In October of 2020, TD Bank filed a complaint against the park's owners, alleging the mortgage hadn't been paid in a year. In February, the bank filed an amended suit, seeking to foreclose.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETPfizer and BioNTech requested the F.D.A.'s authorization to use their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination.Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations."We don't tend to think in business terms of something beloved, and now we're being smacked with the reality of the millions of dollars it takes to operate a park," Ms. Burrows said. "It's hard hearing the word 'auction' and realizing this thing you loved is a commodity, and your cherished memories can be sold for parts."On community Facebook pages, commenters reminisced. Some expressed hope that someone might buy the place and "turn it around," despite the redevelopment potential of 30 lakefront acres in the most densely populated state in the nation, in the midst of a housing shortage.Petitions circulated, and a small local investment group tried frantically to raise enough money to bid for the park. For the residents of Clementon, the threat seemed existential.When small-town parks disappear, "I think you lose a little bit of your soul," Mr. Futrell said. "Part of the identity of the town. When people talk about Clementon in the future, what will that mean?"What It's WorthOne day after the bank's foreclosure action, Bill Firestone, the founder and president of Capital Recovery Group, got the call to sell Clementon Park and Splash World.Mr. Firestone calls himself "an architect of liquidity." He uses the word "liquidity" a lot. "Throughout the distressed world, when there's a request for a liquidity event, that's where we come in," he said.In other words, Capital Recovery Group helps companies that need to sell their assets. Beyond that, Mr. Firestone is simply the guy people call when they need to sell something weird."I've sold so many unusual things in my career," he said. "We've sold fun houses. Steel mills. A Keebler plant. A Kellogg's plant. An Indian Motorcycle plant. A lotion factory. A turbine manufacturer. Stroh's brewing. Miller brewing. Coca-Cola. Dairies. A lake." In 2004, the company oversaw the auction of a major collection of Harry Houdini artifacts.On the wall of his office near Hartford, Conn., Mr. Firestone has a massive graphic art piece proclaiming, "Everything Must Go!" A set of black shelves are loaded with memorabilia: bottles of Ralph Lauren cologne, mechanical parts, a two-foot-long model of a yellow kayak.Really, he said, an abandoned amusement park isn't much different from a closed steel mill. "It's not operating. Every day you're paying security, heat, the equipment is depreciating. The bank just wants to get their money. You have to sell it and move on."Still, he hoped the park would remain a park. "It's unusual, once it gets to me," he said. "But if it was sold all together as an enterprise, where someone could operate it, in this particular case, that would be the highest and best value."In short, even the man selling Clementon Park believed it was still worth more than the sum of its parts. But Mr. Firestone still couldn't say exactly what the park might be worth, because nostalgia can't be quantified."It's a value measured by the purchaser," he said. "It may be measured at zero, but if someone's chasing something, it could be measured at a lot. What would you pay to have something you saw as a little kid? Is it worth more to you than someone else?"The Fairy GodfatherThough many came in person to see the offerings, the auction of Clementon Park happened virtually, through Capital Recovery Group's website. Before it began, the auctioneer explained how it would work: the first lot was for the park in its entirety. The highest bid would be held while the other lots were auctioned. If the combined selling price of those individual lots outweighed the overall bid, the park would be dismantled and sold in pieces.Five minutes in, there was a high bid in place from an unnamed buyer: $2.37 million for the park, its real estate, rides, lake and any other assets.Then, the liquor license sold for $16,000. The Ring of Fire loop ride went for $110,000, and the Thunder Drop for $125,000. The train: $85,000. Carousel: $95,000.It took tense hours to get through all 410 lots, with more than 300 registered bidders. But in the end, Mr. Firestone said, "it wasn't even close." The park, intact and as is, went to the high bidder, a 49-year-old real estate developer named Gene Staples. And this was not the first time he'd made such a purchase.In 2009, he attended an auction of Kiddieland, then Chicago area's oldest amusement park, which was being demolished to make way for a Costco. For Mr. Staples this was a personal tragedy. "I remember, as a small child, going to Kiddieland," he said. "The lights, the fantastic machines, rides in all shapes and sizes. The Ferris wheel. The carousel. Corn dogs and junk foods. It was a magical place. It was a place in your childhood that's like a fantasy world."When he heard about the early 2020 closure of Indiana Beach, another park he remembered fondly from childhood, he couldn't watch it happen again.Founded in 1926 on Lake Shafer, 90 miles or so north of Indianapolis, Indiana Beach was family owned for its first 82 years. In 2008, it sold to one entertainment company, then to another. Early in 2020, citing financial woes, its owners announced that Indiana Beach was permanently closed."The loans got called, they closed, and it looked like this unique park would never operate again," Mr. Futrell said.But Mr. Staples couldn't bear the thought. He had the means, and the promise of a $3 million loan from the county, which relies heavily on the park's tourism draw. So, last April, as the pandemic closed businesses across Indiana, he bought it and has restored it, selling off newer additions that didn't match the character of the park, and bringing back beloved vintage rides.He restored traditions, too: the park's costumed crow mascot bouncing down the midway, and fireworks over the lake every weekend in July. Indiana Beach reopened in June, and even with strict Covid-19 restrictions in place, had a profitable season."To me, it's not so complicated," Mr. Staples said. "Just listen to the people. If you give the people what they want, they'll keep coming back."And the people want Indiana Beach to be what's it's always been — what Jerry Davich, a columnist for The Chicago Tribune, called "the poor second cousin of richer, popular amusement parks," its attractions "hand-me-down yet cherished."It's no accident those metaphors recall family. That's who is supposed to own a park like Indiana Beach, Mr. Staples said."When you have investors and shareholders, you can't make decisions based on emotion and passion, which is how these places were built," he said. "You have to treat a family park like family would. You need to think outside the box, not 'go to the board.' You make decisions by saying, 'let's do it,' whether it's rational or not."Hope SpringsOn a bright, warm Saturday, four days after the auction, Mr. Staples was at Clementon Park's front gate, accompanied by two of his four children, Eiam, 14, and Isabella, 17. He was there to make a list — a long, long list, it turns out — of things that need to be done in order to have the park up and running by Memorial Day. He also just wanted to get to know the place, having only seen it once before, on a quick visit a few weeks before the auction."This was brought to my attention by a ride supplier of ours who was like, 'Maybe you should take a look,'" he said. Reading the park's history online and taking a spin through some local Facebook groups were enough to get him on a plane. "The minute I saw it in person, I knew we needed to do it. I've never been there before, but it reminded me of where I grew up."Mr. Staples wasn't in the market for a second amusement park, and certainly not one 750 miles from the first, but on the drive into town, as the water slides rose into view, he was already sold."It goes back to Kiddieland," he said. "It was a tragedy that it was lost, and to see that happen again, to somebody else's park, is an American tragedy. People tend to tell me about their home amusement parks. Maybe they're not perfect, but to you, they're magic. You think it's just you, but it's not."He and the teenagers climbed onto the carousel. They pulled the worn canvas cover up where it dragged on the ground and clipped it back into place, like giving the ride back its dignity."Amusement park rides to me are like kinetic sculptures," Mr. Staples said. "Especially the vintage rides. They're beautiful pieces of history — machines you have to keep up, keep painted, put love into. The mentality in America is, 'This looks rundown, let's replace it.' But you learn over time that keeping what you have is what keeps people coming back."On inspection day, hearing that I'd grown up in this town, a woman examining a deep fryer asked if I was sad to see the park like this. It was hard to answer, because of course I saw the stillness and decay; but I could also see it just as it was, lit up and full of life.Mr. Staples can see it too. He took in the old bathhouse, its peeling paint and broken windows, and noted they'd have to find some worthy use for a building so special. The log ride, built over the lake in the 1980s and in need of serious work, he called "amazing." It's a priority, he said, to have it running this summer.In the dry stretch of grass where the Jack Rabbit stood, he asked about its hills and turns, wondering aloud whether it might be rebuilt.Mr. Staples is a businessman, and he intends to update Clementon Park in ways that will make it viable and profitable. Part of the picnic grove will become a beer garden, and food vendors will replace coolers packed with homemade lunches. Some of the games along the midway may get a virtual reality makeover. And with a cellphone in every pocket, the untethered freedom of my own youth in the park may really be a bygone.But the true draw, he believes, is the nostalgia itself; the promise that you can go home again, and when you get there, you'll recognize the place."It's a living, breathing thing," he said. "That's what will survive generation to generation. For now, we're just the caretakers."

On a recent afternoon in a brightly lit studio in Brooklyn, Mervin Primeaux-O'Bryant and Brandon Kazen-Maddox were filming a music video. They were recording a cover version of "Midnight Train to Georgia," but the voices that filled the room were those of Gladys Knight and the Pips, who made the song a hit in the 1970s. And yet the two men in the studio were also singing — with their hands.Primeaux-O'Bryant is a deaf actor and dancer; Kazen-Maddox is a hearing dancer and choreographer who is, thanks to seven deaf family members, a native speaker of American Sign Language. Their version of "Midnight Train to Georgia" is part of a 10-song series of American Sign Language covers of seminal works by Black female artists that Kazen-Maddox is producing for Broadstream, an arts streaming platform.VideoA look behind the scenes as Mervin Primeaux-O'Bryant and Brandon Kazen-Maddox collaborate on a signed performance of the classic song.CreditCredit...Up Until Now CollectiveAround the world, music knits together communities as it tells foundational stories, teaches emotional intelligence and cements a sense of belonging. Many Americans know about signed singing from moments like the Super Bowl, when a sign language interpreter can be seen — if barely — performing the national anthem alongside a pop star.But as sign language music videos proliferate on YouTube, where they spark comments from deaf and hearing viewers, the richness of American Sign Language, or A.S.L., has gotten a broader stage."Music is many different things to different people," Alexandria Wailes, a deaf actress and dancer told me in a video interview, using an interpreter. Wailes performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the 2018 Super Bowl, and last year drew thousands of views on YouTube with her sign language contribution to "Sing Gently," a choral work by Eric Whitacre."I realize," she added, "that when you do hear, not hearing may seem to separate us. But what is your relationship to music, to dance, to beauty? What do you see that I may learn from? These are conversations people need to get accustomed to having."A good A.S.L. performance prioritizes dynamics, phrasing and flow. The parameters of sign language — hand shape, movement, location, palm orientation and facial expression — can be combined with elements of visual vernacular, a body of codified gestures, allowing a skilled A.S.L. speaker to engage in the kind of sound painting that composers use to enrich a text.At the recent video shoot, Gladys Knight's voice boomed out of a large speaker while a much smaller one was tucked inside Primeaux-O'Bryant's clothes, so that he could "tangibly feel the music," he said in an interview, with Kazen-Maddox interpreting. Out of sight of the camera, an interpreter stood ready to translate any instructions from the crew, all hearing, while a laptop displayed the song lyrics.In the song, the backup singers — here personified by Kazen-Maddox — encourage Knight as she rallies herself to join her lover, who has returned home to Georgia. In the original recording the Pips repeat the phrase "all aboard." But as Kazen-Maddox signed it, those words grew into signs evoking the movement of the train and its gears. A playful tug at an invisible whistle corresponded to the woo-woo of the band's horns. Primeaux-O'Bryant signed the lead vocals with movements that gently extended the words, just as in the song: on the drawn-out "oh" of "not so long ago-oh-oh," his hands fluttered into his lap. The two men also incorporated signs from Black A.S.L."The hands have their own emotions," Primeaux-O'Bryant said. "They have their own mind."Deaf singers prepare for their interpretations by experiencing a song through any means available to them. Many people speak about their heightened receptivity to the vibrations of sound, which they experience through their body. As a dancer trained in ballet, Primeaux-O'Bryant said he was particularly attuned to the vibrations of a piano as transmitted through a wooden floor.Primeaux-O'Bryant was a student at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in Washington in the early 1990s when a teacher asked him to sign a Michael Jackson song during Black History Month. His first reaction was to refuse.But the teacher "pulled it out" of him, he said, and he was thrust into the limelight in front of a large audience. Then, Primeaux-O'Bryant said, "the lights came on and my cue happened and I just exploded and signed the work and it felt good." Afterward the audience erupted in applause: "I fell in love with performing onstage."Signing choirs have long been common around the world. But the pandemic has fostered new visibility for signing and music, aided in part by the video-focused technology that all musicians have relied on to make art together. As part of the "Global Ode to Joy" celebration of the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth last year, the artist Dalia Ihab Younis wrote a new text for the final chorus of the Ninth Symphony which, performed by an Egyptian a cappella choir, taught elementary signs in Arabic Sign Language.Last spring, the pandemic forced an abrupt stop to live singing as choirs were particularly thought to be potential spreaders of the coronavirus. In response, the Netherlands Radio Choir and Radio Philharmonic Orchestra reached out to the Dutch Signing Choir to collaborate on a signed elegy, "My heart sings on," in which the keening voice of a musical saw blended with the lyrical gestures of Ewa Harmsen, who is deaf. She was joined by members of the Radio Choir, who had learned some signs for the occasion."It has more meaning when I sing with my hands," Harmsen said in a video interview, speaking and signing in Dutch with an interpreter present. "I also love to sing with my voice, but it's not that pretty. My children say to me, 'Don't sing, mother! Not with your voice.'"The challenges of signing music multiply when it comes to polyphonic works like the Passion oratorios of Bach, with their complex tapestries of orchestral and vocal counterpoint and declamatory recitatives. Early in April, Sing and Sign, an ensemble founded in Leipzig, Germany, by the soprano Susanne Haupt, uploaded a new production of part of the "St. John Passion" that is the first fruit of an ongoing undertaking.Haupt worked with deaf people and a choreographer to develop a performance that would render not only the sung words of the oratorio, but also the character of the music. For example, the gurgling 16th notes that run through the strings are expressed with the sign for "flowing.""We didn't want to just translate text," Haupt said. "We wanted to make music visible."Just who should be entrusted with that process of making music visible can be a contentious question. Speaking between takes at the shoot in Brooklyn, Primeaux-O'Bryant said that some music videos created by hearing A.S.L. speakers lack expressivity and render little more than the words and basic rhythm."Sometimes interpreters don't show the emotions that are tied to the music," he said. "And deaf people are like, 'What is that?'"Both men spoke of the impact ballet training had on the quality of their signing. Kazen-Maddox said that when he took daily ballet classes in his 20s, his signing became more graceful."There is a port de bras, which you only learn from ballet, which I was really engraving into my body," he said. "And I watched my sign language, which had been with me my whole life, become more compatible with music."Wailes, too, traces her musicality to her training in dance. "I am a little more attuned with the overall sensitivity to spatial awareness in my body," she said. And, she added, "not everyone is a good singer, right? So I think you'd have to make that analogy for signers as well."

ON THE HOUSEA Washington MemoirBy John BoehnerThere is no shortage of insults in former Speaker of the House John Boehner's memoir. Written in his folksy manner, "On the House" is certainly more entertaining than the standard "halls of power" narratives, as Boehner calls them.Among the many colorful stories, we learn that Boehner once witnessed Donald Trump, before his presidency, lashing out at a staffer during a round of golf for mixing up the names of the two other members of their foursome. The North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows once got down on his knees to plead forgiveness from Boehner after voting against his re-election as speaker in 2013. We get insider accounts of policy battles over No Child Left Behind, economic stimulus and the Affordable Care Act. Of course, there are the obligatory lessons learned from Boehner's high school football coach.But as a work of history, the book falls short. Most important, Boehner doesn't acknowledge the role that his generation of Republicans played in building the bridge from Ronald Reagan's era to our current times.Boehner, whom the House elected as speaker in 2011, is just the kind of blue-collar white male the party aspires to attract. Raised in small-town Ohio, one of 12 children, Boehner grew up in modest circumstances. He started working at his father's "shot-and-a-beer" tavern at 8. A linebacker on his high school football team and graduate of Xavier University, where he worked as a janitor to make money, he moved his way up in the plastics industry while also serving in the Ohio Legislature. He was motivated by a desire to defend small government, lower taxes and deregulation.Boehner was one of the Republicans inspired by the Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich's famous tapes offering advice about running for office. In 1990, he defeated the scandal-plagued incumbent Republican Donald "Buz" Lukens to represent the Eighth District of Ohio. After the House elected Gingrich as speaker in 1995, Boehner served as Republican conference chairman until conservatives ousted both of them in 1998. Known for his chain-smoking, wine drinking and tendency to weep, Boehner returned to power in 2006 when the Republicans picked him as their majority leader. Boehner is determined to tell the story of a party that was extremely different from its current incarnation, at least until Sarah Palin became the party's vice-presidential nominee in 2008.Many readers who lived through Boehner in action in the early 1990s may not remember him as being that different from the insurgents of the Tea Party. Upon entering the House, he joined a group of young conservatives who promoted a dangerous style of smashmouth partisanship that ignored traditional norms of governance. Using C-SPAN and talk radio as their platforms, Boehner lined up behind Gingrich as he called on the party to abandon concerns about bipartisanship and civility in order to obtain power. They weaponized ethics rules and criminalized standard elements of the legislative process to bludgeon Democrats as a corrupt majority.Boehner's cohort fashioned themselves as reformers determined to make Congress a better place. In 1991, he used a report that some members had written bad checks through the House Bank system to attack the Democrats, playing down the fact that numerous Republicans, including Gingrich, had done the same thing. Most legislators had not violated any ethics rules or broken laws, but Boehner and his allies made it seem that way.Senior legislators saw these renegades (Boehner prefers the term "activists") as threatening their ability to govern. Boehner admits that the only reason Republicans voted to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998 was that the majority whip, Tom "the Hammer" DeLay, promised that doing so would "win us all these House seats."The fact that partisanship, rather than reform, drove his actions quickly became clear at the time. Boehner, who is now a lobbyist for the cannabis industry, shed most of his concerns about political civility after Republicans came to power in 1994. He himself emerged at the center of the nexus that connected private money, corporate lobbyists and political parties.It wasn't just that Boehner took money and hired staff members from interest groups. He was in the Republican leadership that started the notorious K Street Project, which created a revolving door between lobbyists and party loyalists. When top staffers left their jobs, they were instantly hired by interest groups that relied on them to gain access on Capitol Hill; as a Republican leader, Boehner played his part. He headed the Thursday Group, which brought together lobbyists and legislators. In 1996, Boehner was caught handing out campaign checks from the tobacco industry on the House floor just as subsidies to the industry were being considered; Boehner dismisses the incident by saying that times were different.Hardly the stuff of reform. Nor was Boehner's commitment to issues very pure. He railed against higher debt when Democrats were in the White House, less so when George W. Bush was the president.The former speaker is determined to wipe his hands clean of the radicals who now dominate his party. The memoir posits a stark divide between the Republican universe before and after 2008. "None of us were crazy — well most of us weren't anyway — and we also knew our limits," he notes. Even in 2009, he insists, the bones of traditional party were still there. Boehner claims that there were a "bunch" of Republicans who would have voted for Obama's stimulus bill if only he had consulted with them. This argument comes from a leader whose Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell, vowed to make Obama a one-term president. It also mischaracterizes an administration that went overboard, to the consternation of liberals, to negotiate with a party hellbent on obstruction.The artificiality of this divide is especially evident in Boehner's discussion of the conservative media. While acknowledging that the world of Fox News is now a "Looneyville" of conspiracy theory, Boehner insists that things used to be different. Although Bob Grant once wished that Haitian immigrants would drown and Rush Limbaugh lashed out against "feminazis," Boehner tells us that the right-wing airwaves used to be tame.Indeed, Boehner is a prime example of how the Republican establishment made peace with extremists in pursuit of power. In describing the younger conservatives in 2008, he shows he understood what he was dealing with, referring to Republicans from "Crazytown" who tried that year to subvert President Bush's stimulus package. And two years later, he recalls, "you could be a total moron and get elected just by having an R next to your name." Yet during that very campaign, Boehner helped provide financial support to Tea Party candidates and heaped praise on them as "the latest example of how the Tea Party movement has done this nation a great service." Though Boehner has continued to be haunted by memories of his ouster by the right in 1998, he knew that harnessing rage could be an effective tactic.It was Boehner, Obama recalls in his recent memoir, who first broached the threat of not raising the debt ceiling in 2011 — a radical move that would have sent the nation into default. When Republicans held the vote on the debt ceiling hostage again in 2013, demanding that Democrats repeal Obamacare, Boehner stood by their side despite thinking it a "dumbass" idea. He acquiesced to shutting down the government to please the Tea Party. As Boehner's chief of staff Mike Sommers admitted, "We fed the beast that ate us." In 2015, he resigned as the Tea Party attempted to oust him.Boehner is so invested in seeing the Tea Party as an aberration that he goes to great lengths to explain the "chaos caucus" through the skewed lens of both sides-ism. After describing the lunacy of the birther movement, Boehner proceeds to claim that the divisions were also the fault of Obama for being too "haughty" and refusing to engage in "outreach."But until senior Republicans acknowledge how they helped radicalize the party, there is little hope that it will transform itself. Boehner's memoirs are an X-ray into the mind of Reagan-era Republicans who did whatever was necessary to win and who today are seeing the high costs of their decisions.

As we move through the spring of The Great Vaccination, many of us are feeling cautious optimism, and also its flip side: creeping dread.Maybe you have a sense of ambivalence about how to interact with others again. If you used to work in an office, you might be worried about returning to work — but eager to see people again. Or you find yourself having to confront a neighbor about a longstanding problem — but you're out of practice with conflict resolution. (I'm not sure I remember how to talk to another human anymore, let alone one I disagree with.)Whatever the specifics, "there will be new forms of social anxiety," said Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology and the director of the Social Interaction Lab at the University of California, Berkeley."People are really anxious about being out in restaurants with friends, or about dancing with a big sweaty group of people — or even about sharing a yoga mat," he said. "It's always good to remember individual differences — there's a lot of variability. But there will be a lasting societal legacy around intimacy, the noise that comes with returning to school, the complexity of the playground and of work."Dr. Keltner has studied human behavior and the biological and evolutionary underpinnings of emotions for decades, with a focus on "pro-social" states — behavior that strengthens connections between individuals — that are especially good for society."We're hyper-social mammals — it's our most signature strength," said Dr. Keltner, a co-founder of the Greater Good Science Center who was also a scientific consultant on emotions for the Pixar film "Inside Out." "It's what sets us apart from other primates: We help, we laugh, we collaborate, we assist."Lately, we've been living our lives siloed away online, missing many of the essential face-to-face experiences that are key to human interaction. It's notable that Dr. Vivek Murthy, the newly reappointed U.S. Surgeon General, has talked not only about the physical and economic toll of the pandemic, but also of "the social recession."Before Covid, this kind of post-isolation anxiety was most often suffered by people who re-enter the civilian world after prison, wartime deployment, humanitarian aid work or remote expeditions. The challenge now is that so many more of us will be experiencing some aspect of this all at once, and coming back to social situations with others who likely have their own fears too. It is stalled social development, on a societal level.Debra Kaysen, a clinical psychologist and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, said that coming back to so-called "civilian life" can be disorienting, surreal and difficult — and not just for combat veterans. Her clinical and research work focuses on anxiety disorders and trauma, and she has worked on developing coping strategies for health care workers dealing with mental health concerns during the pandemic.Now, everyone is trying to navigate conflicting threat levels in a way that used to be specific to those populations, she said. Cues that used to be neutral or positive, like being around other people (I love my friends and family!) are now associated with threat (my friends and family might infect me with Covid!). And we are confronting the challenge of how to turn off that alarm. "What's a true alarm and what's a false alarm has gotten more confusing for all of us," Dr. Kaysen said.So how do we relearn how to be together?Give yourself permission to set small, achievable goals. And accept that other people are going to have different responses than you — the friend or family member who wants to eat inside the restaurant when you don't, for example, or who is ready to get on a plane and take a vacation.Accept that certain activities may feel tough for awhile. Driving an hour to a meeting. Flying a red-eye to a conference. Attending a family reunion, say, or four pandemic-postponed weddings in one month.All of this can prompt you to ask, of your family or your boss or even yourself: "Is it really worth the time?" and "Now that I know things can be different, do I want to go back to my old life?"Recovering doesn't mean you go back to the way you were before, Dr. Kaysen said, using kintsugi, the Japanese technique of repairing broken pottery with gold, as an analogy for coming out of hard times with awareness of the change, and stronger than before. "It's that you create a new normal, one that's functional and beautiful — and different."Dr. Keltner agreed that we may need to "re-educate ourselves" — "like, how do we hug again?" Your timing might be off for a hug, or a joke or even a compliment. "How do you look someone in the eye so that it's not intrusive? How do you compliment someone? You might not have done it for a year."Rather than be overwhelmed by everything at once — for example, going to a party where you have to adjust to greeting acquaintances, eating with others and attempting to make small talk — all at the same time — why not take things step by step? This moment can be an opportunity.8 Exercises to Strengthen Your Social MusclesHere are eight small, science-based exercises Dr. Keltner recommends to help ease back into your community. Go at your own pace.Share food with someone.Eating a meal together boosts mood and is a potent antidote for loneliness — aiming for in-person interaction around the ritual of eating is a great goal, even if you don't meet it every single day. An outdoor picnic or a distanced backyard happy hour is a great and safe option for reconnecting with friends and family.Tell someone a joke in person.You may be out of practice and have to work on your timing. But making eye contact and laughing together is essential to feeling connected to someone else — even if the joke falls flat, being silly together will feel really good.Ask someone what they're listening to or reading right now.Music and literature can be a community-building gift. Listen to music together; exchange books and have an in-person discussion afterward. This is a social exercise, but also one that will give you a much-needed hit of novelty along with the insight.Reach out to someone you've lost touch with.Make a phone call, send a meaningful text, write an email. It's time to start rebuilding the larger social infrastructure outside our immediate circles.Strike up a conversation with a stranger.Pick someone with whom you have passing contact: a fellow dog-walker, the cashier at a grocery store, a delivery person on your doorstep. Make eye contact; talk to each of them as a person rather than as a function. It's so easy to ignore the human behind a mask. Make the effort to ask something outside the normal transaction — what's changed since the last time you saw each other, what they're looking forward to.Move with someone.Dance, walk, run, swim, bike — or even do the dishes and fold the laundry together. Physical synchronicity is one of the most important ways we have to connect with someone else.Sit quietly with someone …and remember how to comfortably be, without talking, in companionable silence, with someone else. Let the other person know it's OK to not always fill the air. Nonverbal communication is important to practice — and it's a way to deepen your relationship.Make a date for the future.Think of something fun to do with someone you love — it could be a summer beach weekend, or maybe a ski trip next winter. Having something to look forward to is essential for well-being. Practice optimism, in anticipation of normalcy. Plan with hope.Bonnie Tsui's books include "Why We Swim" and "The Uncertain Sea."

He struggled to find work. His last-ditch chance to make an N.F.L. team fizzled. He had a child to support and little apparent direction in a life freighted with high expectations. His behavior was increasingly erratic. Then on Wednesday, for reasons no one yet knows for sure, former N.F.L. cornerback Phillip Adams drove to the Rock Hill, S.C. home of a prominent doctor and shot everybody he saw before fatally turning the gun on himself.Now, this football-mad community is struggling to contend with Adams's suddenly violent turn and its aftermath.Before he killed five people, including two children, and critically wounded a sixth person, Adams, 32, who shot and killed himself several hours after his rampage, had seemed adrift since he last played N.F.L. football almost six years ago, friends and associates said. He remained close to home, caring for his mother, Phyllis, a former high school teacher who became a paraplegic after a car accident a decade ago.But for all the pressures on Adams — and family members are openly questioning whether football damaged his brain — many in this city of 65,000 that bills itself as "Football City U.S.A." are grappling with the loss of Dr. Robert Lesslie, an author who co-founded two urgent care clinics, and his family at the hands of a local son whom they rooted for throughout his career."He was the role model that all coaches hoped they could coach," said Jim Montgomery, who coached Adams in football at Rock Hill High School, the alma mater of numerous N.F.L. players. Montgomery said he spent most of Thursday answering phone calls through tears.Officials said Adams fatally shot Dr. Lesslie; his wife, Barbara; two of their grandchildren, Adah Lesslie, 9, and Noah Lesslie, 5. James Lewis, 38 had been working on their home when he was killed and a sixth victim, Robert Shook, is in critical condition.Police have yet to explain why Adams, who was described by friends as "chill" and almost reclusive, singled out the doctor, or whether the two men had any relationship.But Representative Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina, told Charlotte's WBTV Thursday that he had learned from law enforcement officials that Dr. Lesslie had seen Adams as a patient. Sheriff officials would not confirm the relationship."He was treating him and stopped giving him medicine and that's what triggered the killings from what I understand," said Norman, whose district encompasses Rock Hill.Members of the Adams family had their own theories. They wonder whether football may have damaged his brain in a way that has led other players to turn violent and, in a few cases, take their own lives.On Thursday, Alonzo Adams, Phillip's father, told WCNC, a Charlotte television station, "I think the football messed him up." His sister, Lauren Adams, told USA Today that he had recently become uncharacteristically aggressive."His mental health degraded fast and terribly bad," she said. "There was unusual behavior."Adams's brain will be studied to determine whether he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head hits, according to Sabrina Gast, the coroner in York County. It can take months receive a diagnosis for the disease, which has been linked to mood disorders, memory problems, impulsive behavior and other issues, and has been found in hundreds of former football players.Former coaches, colleagues, neighbors and associates who knew Adams described him in interviews as a hard-working athlete who never advanced beyond journeyman status in the N.F.L., but who remained a quiet, helpful presence in town."He was the role model that all coaches hoped they could coach," Montgomery said on Thursday. "In 43 years, if you would've told me that this would have happened with Phillip Adams, I would've put him in the last five of the thousands of kids I coached. It's just a sad day."Duane Belue, a longtime friend and neighbor of the Adams family, said Phillip was close to his mother. Though Phillip had bought a new truck, he did not appear to overspend, and he stayed with his parents for extended periods. Within the last year, the Belues said they noticed that Phillip's behavior had changed. He was less approachable and would pace outside aimlessly."We noticed in the yard, he was out walking, kind of sad," Anne Belue said. "You can't judge somebody that far away, but he was always real friendly before then."A star player in high school and in college at South Carolina State, Adams was picked by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2010 N.F.L. draft. He sustained a devastating ankle injury his rookie season that may have derailed his career."The bone went through the skin," said Scott Casterline, Adams's former agent. "Luckily, he had a good surgeon who helped him. But when a team sees a devastating injury like that, they move on."After the 49ers released him, Adams bounced around the league with stops in New England, Seattle, Oakland (where he suffered two concussions), the Jets and Atlanta.He had one more shot at landing a roster spot, according to Casterline. During training camp in 2016, the Colts called and asked Adams to get to Indianapolis to participate in practice the following day. Casterline urged his client to jump on the next flight, but Adams — who was always gung ho for football — was suddenly hesitant."He made it to the Charlotte Airport, but the flight had left already," Casterline said. "I could tell his head was not in it. He'd given up on it."Casterline described Adams as a loner, not one to go to clubs or drink alcohol. He also hinted at financial troubles. Adams earned $3.6 million during his career and, at one point, wanted to invest in a smoothie shop. Casterline, who said he thought of Adams as a son, told his client it was a mistake because many retail businesses fail.Last fall, Adams called his former agent and asked for help finding employment. Casterline said he tried to convince him to relocate to Dallas and work at one of his companies."I said to just come out here to Texas," Casterline said. "He just wouldn't do it. He had a son. He was a good father and it was difficult with the baby's mother."On Wednesday, the day of the shootings, Adams's father, Alonzo, called Casterline and said he wanted to talk about his son. Casterline did not find the message unusual. Occasionally, Adams's parents called if they were unable to locate their son."I called Alonzo back and left a message, not realizing it had already happened," Casterline said.In a news conference on Thursday, York County Sheriff Kevin Tolson said evidence recovered from the Lesslies' home led them to suspect Adams. Officials said they evacuated the Adamses' home and tried to convince Phillip to surrender. They found him inside, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot.It is often difficult to assign motive to cases where a gunman has not left a note or spoken specifically of his or her intent, even more so in cases that end with the gunman's death.But some of Adams's friends said he never got over how his N.F.L. career ended. Rather than catching on with one team and landing a big contract worth tens of millions of dollars, he bounced from team to team, often playing for the league minimum salary before the calls for his services stopped coming, a common fate in the N.F.L., where colleges produce dozens of cheaper, healthier replacement players every year.The disappointment of washing out was particularly acute for Adams, friends said, because he came from Rock Hill, which has produced so many N.F.L. players that it is known as "Football City U.S.A."To Adams, even a six-year career — twice as long as the average — may have been a letdown when compared to other local players like Jadeveon Clowney, who was picked first overall in the 2014 draft and is a three-time Pro Bowl selection; tight end Benjamin Watson, who played 13 seasons with the Patriots, Saints and other teams; and Stephon Gilmore, a defensive leader on the Patriots."We have a saying around here, you could pay six dollars on Friday night or you can wait a few years and pay $600 to see the kids around here play," said Gene Knight, a broadcaster who has covered the city's sports for decades.Charcandrick West, who played with the Kansas City Chiefs from 2014 to 2018 and shared an agent with Adams, said he and Adams worked out together during a couple of off-seasons. West said Adams was reserved and proud of his Rock Hill Roots."I never saw him get mad at anyone," West said. "He was all about his business, washing and folding his clothes, real neat."West added: "I feel like every athlete tries to keep high expectations. When you're from Rock Hill, such a great football town, he didn't want to known as the guy who bounced around."Casterline, who has worked as an N.F.L. agent for decades, also said Adams had trouble grasping why he didn't catch on with a team."Sometimes, these decisions are political," Casterline said of teams cutting players. "Someone who's drafted in the first round is going to get the most opportunities. That weighed him on a lot. The Patriots cut him three times in one season. They needed him, they didn't, they'd cut him and re-sign him. It's good for the paycheck, but not for the psyche."Knight, the local sports broadcaster, remembered Adams as "a fierce competitor on the field, but he was a gentleman off the field all the times I encountered him."Knight had also been treated once by Dr. Lesslie, a popular and well-known physician in Rock Hill, when he struggled with food poisoning. He said Dr. Lesslie worked on him at 2 a.m., easing his symptoms with intravenous therapy."It's not two people whose paths I thought would cross in this manner," he said. "And I think that's what a lot of people are wrestling with in the whole craziness of this situation."John Jeter contributed reporting from Rock Hill, S.C.

KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent and the Grenadines — A volcano in the southern Caribbean that had been dormant for decades erupted in a billowing blast of gray smoke Friday, spewing clouds of ash for miles and forcing thousands to evacuate. The volcano, known as La Soufrière, on the northern tip of the main island of St. Vincent, in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, had started showing signs of renewed activity in late December. It moved into an "explosive state" on Friday morning, the National Emergency Management Organization said in a Twitter posting. La Soufriere has moved into an explosive state. Plumes up to eight kilometers. Ash fall expected within five minutes#svgeruption2021#— NEMO SVG (@NEMOSVG) April 9, 2021 "It was a very, very loud bang," said Shaquille Hadaway Williams, 22, a St. Vincent resident, describing the moment the volcano erupted. Soon the smell of sulfur permeated the air, he said, followed by clouds of ash, with stones falling on roofs and flashes of volcanic lightning in the sky. "You never see something like this," Mr. Hadaway said. The country's emergency management agency said the ash fall had been registered as far as the country's international airport on the southern part of the island — more than 12 miles away — while an ash plume had billowed 20,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.The morning eruption was followed about six hours later by a "second explosive eruption" that was not as extensive, the agency said. Video clips shot in Chateaubelair, a town on the foothills of the volcano, showed the sky darkened by ash as evacuees wearing face masks trudged through the streets lugging their belongings. Other clips posted on social media showed homes and streets blanketed in grayish white ash."The sky, right now it's very, very dark because of the ash plummeting into the air," said Mr. Hadaway, who had evacuated from his village on the western part of the island on Thursday afternoon as the government warned of possibly imminent eruptions.There were no immediate reports of casualties, and the extent of any damage in the surrounding area was unclear.The eruptions came a day after officials had raised the alert level following several small tremors detected at the volcano, with clouds of steam seen erupting from its peak. The country's prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, ordered a full evacuation of the area. "I want to urge all our people to be calm — do not panic," Mr. Gonsalves said at a news conference on Thursday. "We will come through this stronger than ever."As of Friday morning, close to 20,000 people had been evacuated from the area surrounding the volcano, according to officials.The coronavirus may complicate evacuation efforts, however, according to Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies' Seismic Research Center."The Covid pandemic is still ongoing and you're talking about moving people for what may be weeks, possibly months," Ms. Joseph said in a phone interview. "This is a huge cost in terms of a humanitarian effort."Prime Minister Gonsalves said on Thursday that in order to board the cruise ships sent to evacuate people from the island, evacuees must be vaccinated, while the nearby island nations that are planning to accept refugees will also require vaccinations. Mr. Gonsalves also recommended that those who arrive in shelters on St. Vincent be vaccinated as well. Islands that have said they would accept evacuees include Antigua, St. Lucia, Grenada and Barbados.

Footage shows plumes of smoke spewing from the volcano.CreditCredit...The UWI Seismic Research Centre/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images"Amazing on this dangerous road to Jericho we have the good Samaritans," Mr. Gonsalves said at a news conference on Friday. "It brings home that we are one Caribbean family."Scientists warned that eruptions could continue over days and even weeks."Once it has started it's possible you could have more explosions," said Richard Robertson, a professor of geology at the University of the West Indies, during Friday's news conference. "The first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give."Some of the most destructive volcanic eruptions on record are part of the history of the Caribbean's mountainous islands. In 1995, the Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat, a British territory, roared back to life after more than three centuries of dormancy. Over the next two years it would bury half the 39-square-mile island in ash and rock, including the capital, Plymouth, and render much of Montserrat uninhabitable. Grenville Draper, a geologist at Florida International University, called it "the last really long-lived eruption" in the region.Mr. Draper said the greatest peril from the St. Vincent eruption was not from lava, which is generally slow moving in Caribbean volcanoes, but from pyroclastic flows — fast-moving avalanches of searing hot gas and volcanic debris. "If it starts producing pyroclastic flows, then it's very, very dangerous anywhere on the flanks of the volcano," he said.The 95,000 people on St. Vincent had been on edge for months in fear of an eruption of their volcano.Some still vividly recalled La Soufrière's last eruption, in 1979, which hurled debris thousands of feet but caused no fatalities thanks to a hastily arranged evacuation of residents to local beaches. Its ash reached as far as Barbados, 100 miles east. An earlier eruption, in 1902, killed nearly 1,700 people.Cecilia Jewett, 72, a roads supervisor with the government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said she suffered through the 1979 eruption and recalled the scenes of panic and the desperate scramble for water, the sky darkened by ash and the overpowering stench of sulfur. Her father, she said, survived the deadly 1902 event and told stories of victims buried in ash, and corpses lying in the streets."Those stories come back to my mind on hearing that the La Soufrière was acting up," she recalled when interviewed last December. "It's just too much. These young people would not understand. They think it's just an explosion.""The sulfur, what it does to your eyes, your breathing, your very existence," she continued. "It was a time I would not want to relive."Ernesto Cooke reported from Kingstown, and Oscar Lopez from Mexico City.

To anybody who has ever received a speeding ticket, the resolution of the investigation into Tiger Woods's car crash in February might seem odd.Despite the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's determination that Woods drove well above 80 miles per hour in a 45 m.p.h. zone, he was not given a ticket or charged with reckless driving. Law enforcement officers did not conduct field sobriety tests or obtain a search warrant for a blood test or toxicology report.This week, at a news conference to announce the results of his department's investigation, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said his officers had conducted a thorough investigation and treated the famous golfer as they would anyone else."Now, I know there is some saying that somehow he received special or preferential treatment of some kind," Villanueva said. "That is absolutely false."Some criminal defense lawyers in the Los Angeles area who regularly represent clients accused of reckless driving or driving under the influence questioned whether the Sheriff's Department pursued its case against Woods as aggressively as it had pursued cases against others."I know how law enforcement works there, and this one is curious," said Stephen Sitkoff, a criminal defense lawyer who spent a decade working in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.There are three key portions of the investigation to consider:Why didn't Woods get a speeding ticket?Tiger Woods was driving at least 40 m.p.h. above the posted speed limit when he lost control. But nobody actually saw him driving that fast — a major detail under California law. His approximate speed of about 84 to 87 m.p.h. at the start of the crash was recorded by the vehicle's event data recorder, known colloquially as the black box.California's vehicle code places a strong emphasis on needing a witness to ticket somebody for speeding."In order to issue a citation, you have something to indicate — an independent witness or an observation by a peace officer," said James Powers, the captain of the Lomita Sheriff's Station, which handled the investigation of Woods's crash.Had Woods been issued a citation based on the readings from the data recorder, Powers said and experts agreed, there was a good chance a judge would have thrown the case out."We have gotten accustomed to this very false presumption, which is a computer said so, so it must be true," said Anthony Falangetti, a criminal defense lawyer in Long Beach.Falangetti reeled off a list of ways the data recorder could be challenged if used by itself as evidence: The data recorder could have been programmed improperly, its estimates could be inaccurate and the speedometer in the car could be calibrated incorrectly."There are all sorts of reasons why that circumstantial evidence isn't taken for granted by the sheriff's department," he said.Why wasn't Woods charged with reckless driving?Section 23103 of the California Vehicle Code states that somebody is guilty of reckless driving if they drive with "willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property."Driving 40 m.p.h. over the speed limit on a winding, downhill road arguably meets the criteria for reckless driving. In a weird quirk of the law, it might actually have been easier to charge Woods with reckless driving, a misdemeanor crime that holds the possibility of jail time, than to give him a speeding ticket, because the California vehicle code does not require witnesses to charge someone with reckless driving.Captain Powers, however, said there was no evidence of reckless driving. "For reckless driving, you have to have multiple violations in conjunction with one another — like multiple unsafe lane changes, passing vehicles in an unsafe manner, kind of like road race stuff — and that did not exist here," he said. "Therefore, reckless driving is not appropriate."But a number of lawyers who have defended clients charged with reckless driving disagree."The D.A. could easily get a conviction for reckless driving based on the black box alone," said Hart Levin, a Los Angeles lawyer who specializes in D.U.I. defense. "And even if the black box were somehow not deemed reliable, the accident reconstruction would show the car going in excess of 70 m.p.h. when it hit the tree."Patrick Carey, a criminal defense lawyer and former deputy district attorney, also wonders why Woods was not charged. "I personally have handled cases with much less egregious facts where my clients have been charged in court with misdemeanors," he wrote in an email.But while it's possible Woods could have been charged, Carey said he did not think that a less famous person would necessarily be charged under the same circumstances.That highlights a fundamental but easily overlooked part of the justice system: Thousands of single-vehicle crashes occur every day and law enforcement authorities have wide latitude in how hard they decide to pursue cases.Why wasn't Woods checked more thoroughly in regard to driving under the influence?The Sheriff's Department did not obtain a warrant to draw blood from Woods to test whether or not he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he crashed."Without the signs of impairment, we don't get to the point where we can actually author a search warrant and develop the probable cause to get that, and execute that search warrant — so that did not happen," Captain Powers said.Several pages of the 22-page official crash report are dedicated to laying out the steps sheriff's deputies took to investigate whether Woods was impaired:Field sobriety tests could not be performed because of Woods's injuries.The first deputy on the scene did not smell alcohol, and there were no open containers or prescription medications in the car.While being extracted from his car, Woods responded to questions without delay, his speech was not slurred and his eyes were not bloodshot or watery.The firefighters who treated Woods at the scene said his pupils did not show signs of "narcotic analgesic influence."Video obtained from Woods's hotel on the morning of the crash did not show him swaying or staggering, and he drove away from the hotel safely.The hotel's valet and valet service manager did not notice anything unsafe or unusual.Woods was interviewed at the hospital and there were no signs of impairment.Someone who was with Woods throughout his time in Los Angeles, including the morning of the accident, said they did not observe Woods drinking alcohol or taking any prescription medications. This person's identity is redacted in the report.Four years ago, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving, after he was found asleep at the driver's wheel on the side of the road. He blamed the episode on the interaction between prescription medications he was taking at the time.But just because Woods has previously driven while impaired by prescription medications does not mean the Sheriff's Department could use that to obtain a warrant to test his blood."'He did it before, therefore he did it again' is fundamentally not a constitutional basis for anything," Falangetti said. "We are principally opposed to that kind of accusation in criminal law."Still, the Sheriff's Department could have pushed harder to test Woods's blood, especially considering there was at least minor evidence of prescription pill use. According to the crash report, an "empty plastic pharmaceutical container" with no label was found in a backpack that was resting in the brush next to Woods's vehicle."If it was one of my clients, not anybody special, I think they would have been given a blood test," Sitkoff said.Would pursing the case have been worthwhile?Woods sustained severe injuries in the crash and ultimately, the Sheriff's Department may simply believe it is not necessary to seek more punishment. When asked why Woods was not cited for speeding, Captain Powers said, "Part of it was because of the circumstances that he endured throughout the collision."Woods did not hit another car, and nobody else was hurt. A speeding ticket would most likely have been thrown out, a reckless driving case may have been difficult to prove and there were no obvious signs that Woods was illegally impaired.Under the circumstances, Woods's sustaining devastating leg injuries that hold the possibility of ending his golf career is perhaps a worse punishment than being charged with a misdemeanor."I think that, based on the physical punishment he suffered, it is more of a case of 'What's the point in charging him?'" Carey said.

Victor L. Vescovo had been sitting for several hours inside a small metal ball some 21,000 feet below the surface of the Philippine Sea last month when bright orange specks began appearing on his computer screen. His sonar had found several small pieces of … something."They looked like wreckage," recalled Mr. Vescovo, who spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy before founding an underwater exploration company, Caladan Oceanic.The specks were indeed the first sign that Mr. Vescovo and his team had located what they were looking for in the waters off the Philippines: the wreckage of what was thought to be the U.S. Navy destroyer Johnston, which was sunk by Japanese warships during World War II. The confirmation of the ship's identity was cheered last week by the Navy.The shipwreck, at a depth of more than 21,000 feet — more than four miles underwater — is the deepest ever recorded, according to the explorers.The Johnston sank on Oct. 25, 1944, during the pivotal Battle of Leyte Gulf, widely considered the largest naval battle of World War II. The ship was part of a small U.S. task unit confronting a larger Japanese force that was threatening to cut off the supply lines for an amphibious landing led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the strategic island of Leyte in the Philippines.The Johnston's captain, Cmdr. Ernest E. Evans, sacrificed his ship and "charged into a massive line of Japanese warships in order to protect the American landing force," according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The Johnston was badly damaged by enemy fire and eventually sank.Of the ship's 327 crew members, 186 were lost, including Commander Evans, according to the command. He later became the first Native American in the Navy to receive the Medal of Honor, and he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.The remnants of the Johnston were first discovered in 2019 by another team of explorers, using a remotely operated vehicle at 20,000 feet below the surface, about the vehicle's depth limit. But certain parts of the wreckage, including the ship's hull number, 557, lay beyond that depth. Navy historians said at the time that they needed to do more research to determine if the wreckage was the Johnston or another destroyer that sank on the same day, the U.S.S. Hoel DD-533.The two-person submersible piloted by Mr. Vescovo "has no operating depth limitation," allowing it to go farther than the vehicle used in 2019, according to Caladan Oceanic.The others on the mission were Parks Stephenson, a retired lieutenant commander with the U.S. Navy; and Shane Eigler, a senior submarine technician.Last month, Mr. Vescovo and his team came up empty-handed on two dives. But on a third attempt, something new emerged: "the very sharp pointy end of the bow of the ship," Mr. Vescovo said during a telephone interview this week from his home in Dallas. "We were just stunned at how intact it was."Mr. Vescovo, who was with Mr. Eigler on the dive, slowly steered his submersible to the side of the ship, and, "There it was, bright white numbers, on the hull: 557," he said. "I turned to my co-pilot, because I was very busy piloting the sub and making sure that we were safe, and I said, 'Get a picture! Get a picture!'"It was, he later wrote on Twitter, "an extremely intense experience."On their fourth dive, they took more pictures and video, which showed two five-inch gun turrets, twin torpedo racks and several gun mounts on the ship. And, of course, the giant 557. "Imagery from the site clearly shows the ship's hull number 557 confirming the identity of the wreck," the Naval History and Heritage Command said in a statement on April 1.The trip to the wreckage of the Johnston was not Mr. Vescovo's first headline-making dive. In 2019, he declared that he had made the deepest-ever dive by a human being, after piloting a submersible into Challenger Deep, a spot nearly seven miles down in a long fissure in the western Pacific.(That claim was disputed by James Cameron, the Hollywood director of "The Abyss" and "Titanic," who is also a diving devotee and explored the Challenger Deep during a 2012 expedition.)Mr. Vescovo, who has also climbed Mount Everest and skied the North and South Pole, said this week that he would soon start training for his next adventure: "a significant mountain climb this fall."So, which does he prefer, mountain peaks or ocean floors? He said he had heard that "people are either ocean explorers, like Jacques Cousteau or whomever, or they're mountaineers, but no one does both."But he disagrees: "I believe that everything is kind of connected. The mountains and the oceans are like two sides of the same coin, to me."

BRUSSELS — Talks in Vienna aimed at reinvigorating the Iran nuclear deal that the Trump administration left in 2018 and which Tehran began breaking a year later made some progress this week: They didn't break down.Senior diplomats involved in the talks agreed on Friday that initial steps in two working groups designed to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the accord were positive and would continue next week.Although there are no direct talks between Iran and the United States, the other signatories to the deal — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, under the chairmanship of the European Union — are engaging in a kind of shuttle diplomacy between them.One working group is focusing on how to lift the harsh economic sanctions that the United States imposed that are inconsistent with the terms of the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. The other working group is focusing on how Iran can return to the limits on enriched uranium and the centrifuges to produce it under the terms of the deal.Briefing journalists on Friday evening, a senior State Department official said that not all sanctions that were imposed against Iran during the Trump administration would be lifted — deliberately leaving open the possibility that economic penalties targeting the Central Bank or any terrorism activities would remain in place.But the Biden administration is struggling to unwind the web of sanctions imposed by Mr. Trump that, the official said, sought to obscure which penalties were related to the nuclear deal and which were not. If Iran continues to insist that all sanctions are lifted, the official warned, the negotiations are headed for an impasse.Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian representative to the talks in Vienna, said in a Twitter message after Friday's meeting that "participants took stock of the work done by experts over the last three days and noted with satisfaction the initial progress made." The senior diplomats who meet in what is known as the Joint Commission — representing all signatories except the United States — will reconvene next week "in order to maintain the positive momentum," Mr. Ulyanov said.The Iranian representative, Abbas Araghchi, the deputy foreign minister, said that the Joint Commission would meet again on Wednesday. In the meeting, he emphasized Iran's commitment to the talks and that "this depends on the political will and seriousness of the other parties, otherwise there will be no reason to continue the negotiations," according to comments posted on Twitter by the Iranian journalist Abas Aslani.On Thursday, Mr. Araghchi told Iran's Press TV that he saw hopeful signs from Washington about sanctions relief, but that "I think we have a longer road ahead, although we're moving forward and the atmosphere is constructive."But a spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization said this week that Iran has now produced 55 kilograms, or around 120 pounds, of uranium enriched to 20 percent and within another eight months could reach 120 kilograms. In mid-February the amount was some 17.6 kilograms, which is indicative of why the other powers want to move quickly to bring Iran back to the limits mandated in the deal. Iran is also using advanced centrifuges and making uranium metal, both banned under the deal.U.S. officials have worked to play down expectations for any quick breakthrough and have urged patience. Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, has said that the United States is prepared to lift all the sanctions reimposed and new ones imposed by President Donald Trump after May 2018 that are "inconsistent" with the nuclear deal.Some of the sanctions Mr. Trump imposed are under terrorism and human rights legislation and are not specifically nuclear-related, and it is possible that Washington will try to keep some of them. Harsh sanctions against Iran's Central Bank, for instance, imposed in September 2019, are under terrorism legislation. But analysts believe that Iran will not accept leaving that sanction in place.In what has been perceived as a gesture of good will, Iran on Friday released a South Korean oil tanker that had been held since January in a dispute over billions of dollars seized by Seoul in response to punishing American sanctions.Iran had accused the ship, the MT Hankuk Chemi, of polluting the waters in the Strait of Hormuz, but the seizure was widely seen as an attempt to put pressure on Seoul to release billions of dollars in Iranian assets tied up in South Korean banks in response to U.S. sanctions on Iran.The European Union said in a statement after Friday's meeting that "participants took stock of the discussions held at various levels since the last Joint Commission in view of a possible return of the U.S." to the nuclear deal and "discussed modalities to ensure the return to its full and effective implementation."The commission "was briefed on the work of the two expert groups on sanctions lifting and nuclear implementation measures and participants noted the constructive and results-oriented exchanges."Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Washington.

Just months after returning to the skies, Boeing's troubled 737 Max jet is facing another setback.Boeing said Friday that it had notified 16 airlines and other customers of a potential electrical problem with the Max and recommended that they temporarily stop flying some planes. The company refused to say how many planes were affected, but four U.S. airlines said they would stop using nearly 70 Max jets. Boeing would not say how long the planes would be sidelined.Airlines and Boeing have tried hard in the last several months to convince passengers that the Max is safe. This latest problem is sure to spur further doubt among some travelers about the plane."It's a Max, so everybody is interested and that makes perfect sense, but this is the aviation maintenance system working the way that it should," said John Cox, a former airline pilot and crash investigator and chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation consulting firm.Boeing said the affected airlines should verify that a component of the electrical power system on certain Max planes was sufficiently fastened. Airlines had resumed flying the jet after it was grounded for nearly two years because of a pair of accidents that killed nearly 350 people."We are working closely with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on this production issue," Boeing said in a statement. "We are also informing our customers of specific tail numbers affected, and we will provide direction on appropriate corrective actions."The F.A.A. said Boeing notified it late Thursday of the problem, which could affect the operation of a backup power control unit. The agency said it was working with the company and its customers. "It is premature to estimate the amount of time required as it could take a matter of hours or a few days," Boeing said.Boeing's share price closed down 1 percent, and analysts said the problem did not appear significant."The fix seems to be well understood, and timing would depend on availability of technicians and equipment access," analysts at Jeffries, an investment bank, said in a note.Regulators around the world banned the Max from flying in March 2019 because of the crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia. After a long review, the F.A.A. allowed the Max to fly again in November, provided that Boeing and airlines made changes to the jet, including updating its flight control software and rerouting some electrical wiring. Boeing and the F.A.A. said the potential electrical issue flagged this week was unrelated to that earlier directive.Since the F.A.A. review, aviation regulators around the world have also approved the plane. As of late March, 17 Boeing customers had returned the plane to service, using it for nearly 14,000 flights.Today in BusinessLive Updates:UpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETCatch up: Boeing tells airlines to stop flying some 737 Max planes.Lee Delaney, the BJ's Wholesale Club chief executive, dies unexpectedly.The S.E.C. says 'it may be time to revisit' the rules on SPACs.American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, the top three operators of the Max, said on Friday that they had removed 63 planes from service. Alaska Airlines said it had removed all four of its Max jets.Southwest, which operates an all-Boeing fleet, said in a statement that it had not experienced any "known operational challenges" related to the issue Boeing flagged. Thirty of its 58 Max jets were affected by the notification, and the airline said it had only 15 or fewer Max jets scheduled to fly each day, which were being swapped out for other planes in its 737 fleet."Southwest anticipates minimal disruption to our operation, and we appreciate the understanding of our customers and employees as safety is always our uncompromising priority," it said in a statement.United said that 16 of its 30 Max planes were affected by Boeing's announcement and that they would not be used to carry passengers. American Airlines said the issue affected 17 of its most recently delivered planes, all of which have been temporarily sidelined. American said 24 Max planes delivered before the 2019 grounding were unaffected."As we shared when we returned the 737 Max to commercial service, the safety of our customers and team members comes above all else," American said in a statement. "It's with this unequivocal standard that we rigorously maintain and monitor all our aircraft — including the Boeing 737 Max — to ensure every plane in the air is safe."Wiring has been a concern on at least one other Boeing plane. Workers at the company's plant in South Carolina have complained of careless practices there in the past, including debris left dangerously close to electrical wiring of the 787 Dreamliner, a large plane used on long flights.The families of those killed in the crashes have been critical of both Boeing and the F.A.A., saying neither has done enough to root out the problems that caused the crashes."Boeing proclaims to be a changed company, but it's clear their culture is built around cutting corners and putting profits over safety," Yalena Lopez-Lewis, whose husband, Antoine, died in the crash in Ethiopia, said in a statement on Friday. "Since the deaths of 346 people, their sole focus has not been safety but to perform the bare minimum for regulators to allow it back in the air. This grounding illustrates that the Max is still unsafe to fly."After working to fix the Max and restore its credibility with airlines and regulators for much of the past two years, Boeing has been on an upswing in recent weeks. United said it was speeding up deliveries of the Max and expanding its order to 180 planes in the coming years. Europe and the United States agreed to temporarily suspend tariffs in a long-running dispute over Boeing and its rival Airbus. And February was the first month in more than a year in which Boeing reported net positive commercial airplane sales.The company's stock is up about 17 percent for the year.

The age of electric planes may still be years away, but the fight for that market is already heating up.Wisk Aero, a start-up developing an electric aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane, on Tuesday sued another start-up, Archer Aviation, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and infringing on Wisk's patents.The lawsuit brings into public view a dispute between two little-known companies in a business that has become a playground for billionaires. It also entangles giants of aviation and technology. Wisk is a joint venture of Boeing and Kitty Hawk, which is financed by Larry Page, who co-founded Google. Archer's investors include United Airlines, which is a major Boeing customer and plans to buy up to 200 aircraft from the start-up.The niche market for electric vehicles and planes has become frenzied in recent months as so-called blank check companies, which have little more than a stock market listing and a pot of cash, have snapped up fledgling businesses with little or no revenue, let alone profits. Investors in the blank-check firms — formally known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs — are hoping to acquire businesses that they believe could follow Tesla's recent trajectory on the stock market. To entice those investors, start-ups like Archer promise top-notch technology and optimistic business plans.In its lawsuit, Wisk contends the intellectual property that Archer promoted as part of its merger was stolen by engineers the company hired from Wisk.Filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit accuses two engineers of downloading thousands of files containing confidential designs and data before leaving Wisk to join Archer. Wisk accused a third engineer of wiping history of his activities from his computer before leaving for Archer."Wisk brings this lawsuit to stop a brazen theft of its intellectual property and confidential information and protect the substantial investment of resources and years of hard work and effort of its employees and their vision of the future in urban air transportation," the lawsuit says.Archer denied wrongdoing."It's regrettable that Wisk would engage in litigation in an attempt to deflect from the business issues that have caused several of its employees to depart," Archer said in a statement. "The plaintiff raised these matters over a year ago, and after looking into them thoroughly, we have no reason to believe any proprietary Wisk technology ever made its way to Archer. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously."Archer also said it had placed an employee accused in the suit on paid leave "in connection with a government investigation and a search warrant issued to the employee, which we believe are focused on conduct prior to the employee joining the company."Archer said it and three employees who had worked with the individual had been subpoenaed in that investigation and were cooperating with the authorities. Wisk described the case as a criminal investigation and said it was cooperating with the government.Intellectual property lawsuits are not uncommon in quickly developing and promising industries — as Mr. Page knows well. In one recent case, Waymo, a company owned by Google's parent, Alphabet, accused one of its former employees and Uber of stealing trade secrets to gain an advantage in the race to develop autonomous cars. The companies settled the case in 2018, and the former Waymo employee, Anthony Levandowski, a onetime confidant of Mr. Page's, was sentenced in 2020 to 18 months in prison. Former President Donald J. Trump pardoned Mr. Levandowski in January.Archer announced its merger in February with a SPAC, Atlas Crest Investment, in a deal that valued the company at $3.8 billion. Wisk said its suspicions were confirmed at that time when Archer released a presentation that contained designs similar to those in a Wisk patent filing.Wisk says its Cora aircraft can fly a pair of passengers about 25 miles at a speed of about 100 miles per hour. Archer says it is developing an aircraft that can carry up to four people on a 60-mile trip, topping out at 150 m.p.h. Both aircraft are being designed to fly autonomously.It is unclear whether Wisk's concerns came up in Atlas's evaluation of Archer before the two struck a deal. The SPAC is backed by an affiliate of the investment bank Moelis & Company, which leaned on its bankers, and others to help vet Archer, the bank's founder, Ken Moelis, told The New York Times in an interview when announcing the transaction."We had 35, 40 people on this — and we attacked this like venture growth would or anybody else," Mr. Moelis said. "And we did it fast, too."A spokeswoman for Moelis declined to comment.Other companies trying to make electric aircraft include Joby Aviation, which announced a $6.6 billion deal with a SPAC led by the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman in February, and the German start-up Lilium, which went public last month by merging with a SPAC led by a former General Motors executive, Barry Engle.Those deals are only a small sliver of the SPAC activity this year, as investors, celebrities and athletes have all raced to partake in Wall Street's new favorite toy. So far this year, 299 SPACs have raised $97 billion, according to SPAC Research — more than in all of 2020.But regulators and some investors say more scrutiny is needed. The Securities and Exchange Commission published two notices last month warning companies considering merging with SPACs to ensure that they are ready for all the legal and regulatory requirements being a public company entails. Many investors known as short sellers, who specialize in betting that share prices of companies are bound to fall, have targeted SPACs like Atlas Crest, which is among the 20 most-shorted SPACs.The market for electric aircraft is in its infancy but holds huge promise. The prospect of "Jetsons"-like flying vehicles has inched closer to reality in recent years thanks to advances in battery and aircraft design. A high-stakes race to build the first viable electric plane is underway, and some airlines are betting that such vehicles can help them reach their goals of eliminating or offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions.Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United, said the Archer aircraft were unlikely to be used for commercial flights but were ideal for short trips to and from an airport."They're not only more environmentally friendly, they're far quieter than a helicopter," Mr. Kirby said Tuesday during an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations. "And, because they have 12 rotors, they're, I believe, going to ultimately be safer."Still, widespread use of electric air taxis is likely years away. Such aircraft may never become more than a luxury used by very rich people because businesses and governments may come up with far cheaper ways to transport people without emissions.

Anne Beatts, who wrote for "Saturday Night Live" from its beginning in 1975 until 1980, a raucous, innovative period that established the show as a central feature of the American cultural landscape, died on Wednesday at her home in West Hollywood, Calif. She was 74.Her family announced the death in a statement. The cause was not specified.Ms. Beatts had written for National Lampoon and other outlets when the producer Lorne Michaels signed her for a new late-night sketch show to be aired live on NBC on Saturdays."I was lucky that when Lorne Michaels came looking for women comedy writers there weren't too many in New York at the time," she told The Orange County Register in 2013. "I was at the top of a very short list."The show's early years featured cast members who quickly became household names, like Gilda Radner, Chevy Chase and John Belushi. The show's writers often worked in pairs, and Ms. Beatts frequently wrote with Rosie Shuster, creating sketches like the "Nerds" series, which featured Lisa Loopner (Ms. Radner) and Todd DiLaMuca (Bill Murray), a spectacularly awkward couple."That was probably our biggest hit," Ms. Beatts told The Register.Ms. Shuster, in a phone interview, said that she and Ms. Beatts had made a point of writing material for the women in the "S.N.L." troupe. And, she said, Ms. Beatts had no problem holding her own in the largely male "S.N.L." writers' room."Because she had worked at the Lampoon with a lot of guys, she wasn't a shrinking violet," Ms. Shuster said.Alan Zweibel, who was a part of that room, remembered a humorist with an edge."Her words were like weapons — really sharp, really satirical," he said. "Not only was there a wit; there was a little bit of anger there. But it landed."Ms. Beatts often wrote the parodies of TV commercials that the show used at the time, and sometimes she appeared in them. Mr. Zweibel especially remembered an absurdly overachieving housewife she played in one fake ad — the woman's secret was a product called Speed.Ms. Beatts, Mr. Zweibel said, "came at things from a different angle," a quality the cast member Laraine Newman also remembered."Anne Beatts's writing was very personal and specific," she said by email. "She brought things to the fore that we all knew about but weren't depicted or defined. For instance, the Nerds. That was so Anne in its detail. The fact that Lisa Loopner ate egg salad sandwiches. Her writing was very direct, muscular and dark at times, and who doesn't love that?"Having explored nerdiness with Lisa and Todd, Ms. Beatts drew from that well again after leaving "S.N.L." in 1980. In 1982 she created "Square Pegs," a CBS comedy series that lasted only 20 episodes but anticipated the trend of TV shows about the pressures and pitfalls of high school as experienced by the outcast crowd. It centered on two awkward girls, Patty and Lauren, who were constantly under siege by the cool kids.Patty was played by Sarah Jessica Parker, then largely unknown. Ms. Beatts said the character was based on herself and her experiences at Somers Central High School in the Westchester County town of Somers, N.Y. She intended the show to be a sort of pep talk for students going through similar high school hell."I just wanted to say to the Laurens and the Pattys and others that no matter what they're suffering now, they may be glad about it later," Ms. Beatts told The New York Times in 1983. "Because most of the bright, successful, happy people I know were pretty miserable in high school."Anne Patricia Beatts was born on Feb. 25, 1947, in Buffalo. Her parents, Pat and Sheila Beatts, were both educators. She graduated from McGill University in Montreal, where she worked on the campus newspaper, The McGill Daily."I had always wanted to be a writer," she told The Gazette of Montreal in 2011, "but I was afraid to say it before I started working at The Daily."After graduating, she worked in Toronto for a time, then ended up in New York. She acknowledged that the easiest way for a woman to be noticed in the humor world at the time was to be dating a guy who was part of it. For her, that was Michel Choquette, a founding figure at the Lampoon, which was started in 1970; she tagged along with him to strategy sessions."Nobody wanted me there, but nobody wanted to say, 'Make her stay home,'" she told The Contra Costa Times in California in 2004, "so I went to the editorial meetings in some of the worst restaurants in New York City." She added: "Everybody would talk and throw out ideas, and at the end they'd ask who had this and who had that, and I'd find myself raising my hand. So I sort of wormed myself in."A few years later, she was involved with Michael O'Donoghue, an original "S.N.L." writer."Lorne had this idea of couples, like going on board the ark," she said. "Once you were on you couldn't get off."She almost turned down Mr. Michaels's offer because she was working on a book."Then a friend of mine said, 'Are you crazy?'" she recalled in the 2004 interview.Her time at "S.N.L.," she said, was exhilarating but difficult."It was a combination of summer camp and concentration camp," she told The Miami Herald in 1982.After "Square Pegs," Ms. Beatts, who settled on the West Coast, wrote for other shows and occasionally produced, including episodes of "A Different World" in the 1980s. At her death she was a lecturer at Chapman University in Orange County, Calif.She is survived by a daughter, Jaylene Beatts; a sister, Barbara; and a brother, Murray.Ms. Beatts completed that book she had been working on when Mr. Michaels called. Published in 1976, it was a compilation she edited with Deanne Stillman and was called "Titters: The First Collection of Humor by Women." She was a longtime advocate of giving women a bigger voice in comedy, and of purging the sexism in that world.In 1978 The New York Times ran an item that mistakenly referred to Ms. Beatts as a former editor of National Lampoon. The magazine's editors wrote in to correct the record."While for some time a listed and valuable contributor, she never served in an editorial capacity," they wrote. "Since, elsewhere and frequently, Ms. Beatts has been at pains to condemn the National Lampoon's conscious and unconscious sexism in the area of humor, it seems unlikely that she would want such an error to spoil her otherwise formidable record."

Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, said she would not attend the next international climate talks unless everyone can be vaccinated equally and participate safely."Inequality and climate injustice is already the heart of the climate crisis," she said on Twitter on Friday. "If people can't be vaccinated and travel to be represented equally that's undemocratic and would worsen the problem."More than three-fourths of the vaccines distributed worldwide have been used by the world's richest countries. Those rich countries pre-ordered more vaccines than they needed for their populations, while other countries had trouble securing any doses at all. As of March 30, only 0.1 percent of doses had been administered in low-income countries.The international climate talks, an annual affair run by the United Nations, are scheduled to take place in November in Glasgow. They were canceled last November because of the coronavirus pandemic.Formally known as the Conference of the Parties, to be attended by the countries that signed the United Nations climate change pact, these talks are designed to forge agreements among countries to slow down global warming. At or before the next talks, countries are expected to announce how they plan to strengthen their own climate action targets.Ms. Thunberg announced her misgivings about attending the climate talks first in an interview with the BBC. Her remarks drew attention to a central question nagging at the organizers of these talks: Should they go ahead in person, even if everyone who wants to attend is not vaccinated by then? Britain, the host country, has said the conference will be held as planned, in person.Ms. Thunberg, in a Twitter thread, said the meeting could be put off until later, but "that doesn't mean we have to delay the urgent action required.""We don't have to wait for conferences nor anyone or anything else to dramatically start reducing our emissions," she wrote.Ms. Thunberg, 18, once described herself as "the invisible girl." Her solo strike on the streets of her native Stockholm helped to spur a global youth movement for climate action, and she has become known for speaking bluntly to power at high-profile diplomatic conclaves. She has rebuked global political and business elite at Davos, excoriated presidents and prime ministers at the United Nations, and marched alongside her peers from around the world.Ms. Thunberg has a vast following among young climate activists, and it remains to be seen whether other youth climate activists would attend the talks in Glasgow or stay away."Right now many countries are vaccinating healthy young people, often at the expense of risk groups and front line workers (mainly from global south, as usual…)," she said on Twitter.

Every Monday and Friday, Margaret offers hyper-specific viewing recommendations in our Watching newsletter. Read her latest picks below, and sign up for the Watching newsletter here.This weekend I have … a half-hour, and I want a comedy'South Side'When to watch: Now, on HBO Max.This comedy about a repo company on the South Side of Chicago aired on Comedy Central in 2019 and is now finally streaming. Sultan Salahuddin and Kareme Young star as Simon and K, recent junior college grads who work for Rent-T-Own and amass side hustles. "South Side" is fully hatched right from the pilot: Its characters have funny and original individual voices, its world makes sense, and it crams in more jokes per scene than some shows manage in an entire episode. If you want a comedy that moves easily between farce, one liners and silly whimsy, or if you just have strong feelings about Harold's mild sauce, watch this.… a half-hour, and I want a British comedy'The Other One'When to watch: Now, on AcornIf you already watched the odd-couple brother comedy "Back" on Sundance Now, try this import that feels like the sister version. Cat and Cathy (Lauren Socha and Ellie White) have nothing in common — except their father, whose recent death revealed to Cathy and her mother that he had a secret other family. And also that he'd given his two daughters the same name. A lot of class-conflict shows have a mean streak, but "The Other One" has a bright and fizzy ease and a story that zips along, and the seven episodes bounce by in a flash.… a half-hour, and I'm in the homestretch'America's Test Kitchen'When to watch: Now, on the show's website or smart TV app.The current season of "America's Test Kitchen" was filmed during the pandemic, with the various hosts cooking in their own home kitchens — fun for the real-estate voyeur and home chef alike. These episodes look and feel so similar to the regular version that unless you're the one person who specifically craves the show's banter, you may not even notice the change. The series models the kind of gentle positivity we can all use a dose of right now as we emerge from our year of isolation like a newly healed limb, all withered and sensitive from being inside a cast.

FIRST PERSON SINGULARStoriesBy Haruki MurakamiTranslated by Philip GabrielMagicAll fiction is magic. That's the thought that occurred to me often as I read "First Person Singular," the brilliant new book of stories by Haruki Murakami, author of international best sellers.The freezing man in Kafka's "Bucket Rider" floats above icy streets in a bucket, asks a couple for coal and then flies away when he is refused. In Langston Hughes's neglected "On the Road," a homeless Black man who is denied help by a white pastor grabs the stone pillars of a church and pulls it down — and we accept it. As long as we've been properly grounded by a careful set of instructions, we readers will have visions.Whatever you want to call Murakami's work — magic realism, supernatural realism — he writes like a mystery tramp, exposing his global readership to the essential and cosmic (yes, cosmic!) questions that only art can provoke: What does it mean to carry the baggage of identity? Who is this inside my head in relation to the external, so-called real world? Is the person I was years ago the person I am now? Can a name be stolen by a monkey?The BridgeMurakami is wildly popular around the world, which makes him somewhat suspect in literary circles. Because his style has supposedly drawn too much from the West, some Japanese critics have labeled it batakusai, which translates roughly to "stinking of butter." His reputation, by his own admission, is better internationally than it is in Japan.His novels — the astonishing "Wind-Up Bird Chronicle," the sprawling "1Q84" — spiral like galaxies from central cores, but his stories are quasars, exploding with light as they reveal his themes. I've begun to think of Murakami's works as teaching stories, like "Tales of the Dervishes," by Idries Shah, or even the Parables. His great subject is ultimately the enigma of time as it relates to the inner self, to the musical mystery underneath everything.In what feels like a classic example of the anxiety of influence, Murakami has long pushed back against the weight of Kenzaburo Oe, whose 1964 book "A Personal Matter" exemplified the Japanese I-novel, a form of autofiction before autofiction was even a word, and took the literary world by storm. But recently, in an introduction to "The Penguin Book of Japanese Short Stories," he admitted that his I-novel allergy had become less intense. One can feel him easing up in the eight stories collected in "First Person Singular," allowing his own voice — or what sounds like his own voice, wonderfully translated by Philip Gabriel — to enter the narratives, creating a confessional tone that reminded me of Alice Munro's late work.Murakami is not popular throughout the world because he consciously integrates Western ideas and language into his fiction, but because his work — fueled by a tension with his forebears — fuses cultures, or perhaps leaps over them, defying time, beating like pop songs, touching universal nerves.Charlie ParkerTom Waits once said that "if you want to catch songs you gotta start thinking like one," and you could imagine Murakami's process as an extension of this, catching stories via musical thinking, whether it's jazz in "Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova," pop in "With the Beatles" or classical in "Carnaval," all included in this collection. There's a constant interplay in the book between the way music works and the way narrative unfolds. (If you want to get a sense of Murakami's physical relationship to music, read his wonderful, intimate discussions with the conductor Seiji Ozawa, in "Absolutely on Music.")In a recent radio interview he claimed that music was his writing teacher — just as he has said that his writing is informed by his distance running. (But that's too simple. All writers attempt to find some hook to explain the unexplainable.)"Charlie Parker Plays Bossa Nova" is a fanfic love song, powered by a compassionate desire to resurrect. It starts with a review of an imaginary Parker album, written as a lighthearted prank by the narrator when he was a college student. But years later, to his bewilderment, he spots this nonexistent record in a store on East 14th Street.Murakami gives himself a chance to talk to Parker, through a dream his narrator has at the end of the piece. Bird speaks to us; he's real. The story becomes a tender reclamation of the past, written with devotion and love, powered by a beautiful truth: that the artists we love are constantly resurrected by our experience of their work.(Reading it, I got the same feeling I got watching the late Chadwick Boseman in "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," and when I searched Spotify later, it made sense that someone had already created a playlist, an imagined album from the story, which made me think about the destabilizing forces that feed our visions: the shaky world of postwar Japan, perhaps, for Murakami, who was born in 1949 amid wreckage and a sudden infusion of new cultures, or a larger contemporary world in which cultures now destabilize one another, collapsing time and distance, creating wonderful new art — a Bad Bunny song, sung in Spanish, pulsing on a trap beat crafted in Los Angeles, drifting atop a roar of digital current.)RealitySometimes I think we forget, or refuse to admit, that as soon as a story exists in print and is read, it becomes real. Maybe it's time we simply retire the term "magic realism," because all fictions are both realistic and magical.There are two opposite tendencies in literature, according to Italo Calvino: "One tries to make language into a weightless element that hovers above things like a cloud. … The other tries to give language the weight, density and concreteness of things, bodies and sensations." Murakami has found his own path — as light as a runner between strides, floating for a few seconds in the zero gravity of movement, and as heavy as the footfalls on the soles of his Mizuno running shoes. Like Raymond Carver's work, Murakami's stories — his early ones in particular — are guided by clear, strong voices that are deceptively easy to read, digestible but always leading to a precise pivot, from that seemingly smooth gloss of realism, toward a deeper musical wisdom.The Beatles"With the Beatles" opens with a young woman walking down a school hallway, clutching a Beatles album, and becoming an image the narrator will never forget (he never sees her again). The narrator — as observed by his older self — then remembers his first girlfriend and an autumn day in 1965, when he went to her house for a date, found her gone and instead spent time with her brother, who suffered from acute memory loss.To kill time, waiting for the young woman to arrive, he read aloud the final section of the 1927 story "Spinning Gears," by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. Later, when we leap forward several years to a chance encounter with the brother, up in the mountains of Kobe, and learn of a tragedy that recalls the fate of Akutagawa, who killed himself shortly after writing his astonishingly contemporary story, we see Murakami bowing to one of his literary ancestors. An indelible imprint, the narrative power of the past.(Describing how these stories succeed is like trying to describe exactly why, more than 50 years later, a Beatles song still sounds fresh — the songwriting energies from the psychedelic John Lennon combined with the hard-core realism of Paul McCartney forming a singular vision. I'm tempted to say here that Murakami's vast popularity comes from the fact that he's a fusion of Lennon and McCartney [and perhaps Glenn Gould].)CreamMurakami forces us into our past, when we were young enough to believe in the old, hippie word "cosmic," when we could all get high just by trying to imagine a circle with no circumference.A teenager ends up on a mountaintop in Kobe, sitting in a garden, listening to an old man talk. "Your brain is made to think about difficult things," the man explains. "To help you get to a point where you understand something that you didn't understand at first. You can't be lazy or neglectful. Right now is a critical time. Because this is the period when your brain and your heart form and solidify."Was the plot of this story, "Cream," just a MacGuffin to get us to this scene? Maybe, but who cares? We're right there with them in that garden, and we have learned again what it means to seek mystery. That's how Murakami's stories often roll, luring us into strange moments, making us ask the questions we once chewed on about life, about what it means to bear the burden of selfhood, about how time seems to bend around us like the wind around the trees — invisible but clearly active.As a short story writer myself, I feel my own acute inability to urge the reader to spend time with this collection, to purchase a sequence of brief experiences that will not, as a novel might, immerse them in the hours of a steadily unfurling narrative. But these are flickering, quick times, and what a story can do that a novel can't is pull us into the intricate motions of a single instant, expansive on both ends — the before of everything before the narrative begins, and the infinite future beyond the terminal sentences — and, like a song, or a poem, leave us wanting to reread, to rehear the voice, to relocate the pinpoint in the map of our lives.The Stone PillowLet's turn now to a one-time hookup (the translator's word) and explore the nature of erotic bliss — the distance between touch and memory. The tone, as in all of the stories in this book, is autumnal, and failures of memory are openly admitted. A young woman writes tanka poems, and when she and her lover end up naked in each other's arms, she warns him that when she orgasms, she will yell the name of someone else. He's fine with this but he asks her to bite a towel because the walls are thin."Loving someone is like having a mental illness that's not covered by health insurance," she explains. (Again, we're back to some place we've forgotten, young enough to seek, to feel the wildness of reality, just as we might feel listening to Patti Smith — perhaps Murakami's most devoted fan — singing "Dancing Barefoot.")The story, "The Stone Pillow," flows to a moment years later, when the narrator finds a tattered book, the young woman's, and reads a few of the poems, opening up one of Murakami's profoundly beautiful arias:"If we're blessed, though, a few words might remain by our side. They climb to the top of the hill during the night, crawl into small holes dug to fit the shape of their bodies, stay quiet still, and let the stormy winds of time blow past. The dawn finally breaks, the wild wind subsides, and the surviving words quietly peek out from the surface. For the most part they have small voices — they are shy and only have ambiguous ways of expressing themselves. Even so, they are ready to serve as witnesses. As honest, fair witnesses. But in order to create those enduring, long-suffering words, or else to find them and leave them behind, you must sacrifice, unconditionally, your own body, your very own heart. You have to lay down your neck on a cold stone pillow illuminated by the winter moon."The MonkeyPerhaps the most revelatory story in the book is a sequel to an earlier, widely anthologized piece, "A Shinagawa Monkey," first published in The New Yorker in 2006. In it, a monkey sneaks around Tokyo stealing names — literally stealing them, so that the victims can't remember their own names. "It's a sickness I suffer from," the monkey says, when he's finally captured and interrogated. "Once I fix on a name, I can't help myself. Not just any name, mind you. I'll see a name that attracts me, and then I have to have it. I know it's wrong, but I can't control myself."All of the victims are young women whom the monkey finds desirable, and given the criticism sometimes leveled at the male gaze in Murakami's work, it can be tempting to read the follow-up, "Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey," as an overearnest attempt at atonement, an assurance that the impulse was driven by sincere admiration — love — not lechery."I make the name of the woman I love a part of me," the monkey tells the narrator, over cold beers in a hotel in Gunma Prefecture. It is "a completely pure, platonic act. I simply possess a great love for that name inside of me, secretly. Like a gentle breeze wafting over a meadow." Still, he says, he has made up his mind to stop.One senses a greater task for the author: probing earlier creative impulses, examining the relationship between his own life and the act of conjuring lives out of nothing. This is the current that runs through all fiction — the musical frisson between the real and the imagined. What better way to remake, without wholly rejecting, your past self than to re-evaluate your creations, your fictive ghosts?This story isn't an excusing of the past but a kind of reconciliation, and when, at the end, we realize that it's highly possible that the monkey is still out there stealing names, unable to control himself, we feel that Murakami — older, wiser, faults acknowledged — is also out there, making up stories, imagining the other, making that leap over the chasm between real and unreal, thickening, with each tale he creates, the perplexity of his own art.What does it mean to carry the name of a beloved inside you, the narrator wonders, after his encounter with the monkey. Indeed, what does it mean to carry my beloved wife's name, Genève, inside me? The question amplifies the glory of life — the loneliness and joy of hauling around the baggage of my own identity, which I'm able to escape only when I'm bearing someone else's story, dreaming my way in.

Disney owns a piece of every living person's childhood. Now it owns Marvel Studios, too. The co-hosts Jenna Wortham and Wesley Morris look at depictions of racist tropes and stereotypes in Disney's ever-expanding catalog. The company has made recent attempts to atone for its past. But can it move forward without repeating the same mistakes?On Today's EpisodeThe Marvel Cinematic UniverseEarlier this year — during "season three of the pandemic" — Jenna binged the M.C.U., the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While she appreciated the moral messaging of the movies, which are centered on a fight against evil forces, she was appalled by the lack of nonwhite characters. "You mean to tell me they've been making these movies for over a decade — 12 years — and you have still not managed to decenter the whiteness of this universe?" she exclaimed.Jenna and Wesley talked about these offerings from the Marvel universe: "Avengers: Endgame" (2019), "WandaVision" (2021) and "The Eternals" (2021).The Disney of Your Childhood and NowWesley and Jenna discussed how rewatching classic Disney movies with adult eyes has been unsettling, from the colonial undertones in "The Little Mermaid" (1989) to the Orientalist tropes peddled in "Lady and the Tramp" (1955).Disney, however, has tried to atone for its history. On the Disney+ streaming service, some older movies, such as "Dumbo" (1941) and "The Aristocats" (1970), contain warning labels about "negative depictions" and "mistreatment of people or cultures." And one musical, "Song of the South" (1946), does not appear on the platform at all.Still, the labeling effort isn't comprehensive and seems to address only movies with instances of blatant racism, Jenna noted. "It's worth interrogating how all of these movies reinforce the ideas that are so harmful in the formation of this country," she added.In recent years, Disney has started to make movies that feature more diverse casts and story lines, such as "Coco" (2017), "Moana" (2016) and "Soul" (2020). They've also remade classics, including the live-action "Mulan" (2020) and a super-realistic version of "The Lion King" (2019).Black FuturesJenna mentioned the essay, "Fandom, Racism, and the Myth of Diversity in the Marvel Cinematic Universe," which unpacks how Black and Asian stereotypes are employed in Marvel comics.She also pointed to Alisha Wormsley's art project "There are Black People in the Future," which began as "a response to the absence of nonwhite faces in science-fiction films and TV."Alisha's project gets at the importance of thriving representation in popular culture. "What is on our screens matters so much," Jenna said, and "has a huge impact on how we see ourselves." She added: "We have to be able to imagine ourselves whole, happy and healthy in the future for that to be possible today."Hosted by: Jenna Wortham and Wesley MorrisProduced by: Elyssa DudleyEdited by: Sara Sarasohn and Sasha WeissEngineered by: Corey SchreppelExecutive Producer, Shows: Wendy DorrExecutive Editor, Newsroom Audio: Lisa TobinAssistant Managing Editor: Sam DolnickSpecial thanks: Nora Keller, Julia Simon, Mahima Chablani and Desiree IbekweWesley Morris is a critic at large.

For a low-season trip to Honolulu in 2019, I scoured the internet for cheap, cheerful lodgings and the best I could come up with in Waikiki started around $300 a night. Looking ahead to this summer, 18 months and one pandemic later, the Ewa Hotel Waikiki has a condo suite with a kitchen and terrace for $129 a night, and the retro White Sands Hotel nearby has rooms from $179.Travel sales have reigned since the beginning of the pandemic, with few takers. Now, with the national vaccine rollout steaming full speed ahead, the travel industry, for better or for worse, is juicing its attempts to get Americans off their couches and into hotels, ships, airplane seats and tour buses, despite the rise in virus cases in many areas.In the near term, 2021 still looks a lot like 2020, with mostly domestic travel and low airfares."What we will likely see is a repeat of last year, where beach destinations, national parks and state parks did OK," said Jan Freitag, the chief hospitality analyst at the CoStar Group, a commercial real estate research company. Mr. Freitag expects hotel occupancy to hover around 50 percent through the year, keeping prices low.As travel picks up, bargains will fade, though the timing remains unclear. For those who are vaccinated and confident about venturing out, knowing the deals aren't likely to get any better may make them more compelling, even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to warn against nonessential travel.Many immediate spring deals reflect shoulder season sales — April or May are usually good times to visit places like Nantucket, Mass., Jackson Hole, Wyo., Cooperstown, N.Y., and Laguna Beach, Calif. Others encourage you to plan now for future travel. In either case, if you do decide to travel, check the cancellation policies before you buy; many travel companies have relaxed them, but not all.The following trends illustrate the lengths to which the industry is going to prime the pump for a return to travel.Destination-wide dealsYou know it's the season of the sale when much of Los Angeles, like other destinations, slashes prices.In a travel comeback campaign, Los Angeles Tourism has assembled around 70 offers from local businesses, including up to 35 percent off hotels, tours and attractions (travel dates and restrictions differ). With it, the Hotel Erwin has 30 percent off rooms priced prediscount from $279; Handlebar Bike Tours has $5 off its day trips (use the booking code Comeback).In the Caribbean, Bonaire is running an island-wide "Bonaire Misses You" campaign that offers 10 percent off at more than 50 participating businesses, including hotels, car rentals, restaurants and activities such as scuba diving, through August. (Bonaire's entry requirements include a negative Covid test result.) Better yet, Bamboo Bonaire resort is taking $45 off its nightly rates for cottages, which start at $179, on stays of three nights or more, between April 10 and Dec. 18.Modeled on New York City's winter Restaurant Week, Rhode Island Hotel Week, initiated in 2020, aims to drum up business in the bleak month of January. This year, the sale, moved because of the pandemic, is on now for travel April 17 to 30, with more than 40 hotels, inns and B&B's offering nightly rates at $100, $200, $300 or $400, representing at least 30 percent off. They range from the hipster Dean hotel in Providence ($100) to the Weekapaug Inn in Westerly ($400).Brand-spanning room salesLike destinations, some hotel companies are going all in on booking incentives. Accor, the hospitality company that includes hotels under the Fairmont, Sofitel and 21c Museum Hotel brands, is holding a sale on 38 of its 50 hotels in the United States between April 15 and Sept. 6 for stays April 15 through Dec. 31. Discounts are based on length of stay, but it pays to join their free loyalty program as members get rates reduced up to 40 percent versus 30 percent for nonmembers.The 21-hotel Opal Collection in Florida, New York and Maine is offering 20 percent off rooms, including breakfast for two, through May 31. After the discount, starting rates run from $167 at the Samoset Resort in Rockport, Me., to $499 at Lake Placid Lodge in Lake Placid, N.Y.At seven of its all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, the Caribbean and Florida, Club Med is offering 45 percent off bookings made through May 4 for travel through Nov. 5. Rates after the discount start at $136 per person.Move in, or at least stay a whileThe care needed to travel, including testing and quarantining, has slowed things down, just as work-from-home lifestyles have encouraged working from anywhere. Longer stays — of a week, a month or more — remain popular sales offers.In New Orleans, Hotel Peter & Paul, housed in a 19th-century former church complex, has a "snowbird" promotion offering 30 nights for $3,000, which can also be broken into multiple stays, through Aug. 1. The standard nightly rate for a comparable room, a split-level suite with small appliances like a coffee maker and a mini fridge, starts at $224.Make it a month for $2,500, including breakfast, through 2021 at the Santarena Hotel in Las Catalinas on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica, where rooms normally start at $200. A month at the Freehand Hotels, located in New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, costs $2,499 and includes 10 percent off food and beverage bills, among other perks.Luxury hotels want you to stay longer, too. In Marrakesh, Morocco, the stylish hotel El Fenn — inhabiting a series of 12 interconnected riads — is offering weeklong stays at $2,076 for two, a savings of more than $1,100. (Travel requirements include a negative Covid-19 test and proof of a hotel reservation.)Stay 14 days or more at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on the island of Hawaii to get 40 percent off its rates, which start at $699, through Dec. 18.City hotels want you backWithout business travelers, urban hotels are urging leisure visitors in with generous rates and perks. In Washington, D.C., the Hamilton Hotel has rooms at 35 percent off through April, starting around $99 post-discount.Weekends from April 1 to Sept. 6, the Walker Hotels in Greenwich Village (from $259) and Tribeca (from $134) in New York City are offering 9 a.m. check-ins on Fridays and 6 p.m. checkouts on Sundays. Guests staying in April also get a bottle of wine and bike tours of the city guided by bike messengers.If you are jetting off for a vacation from Minneapolis, the suburban Radisson Blu Mall of America is offering a one-night, predeparture stay from $184, including transfers to and from the airport, and seven nights of valet parking while you're away, through the end of the year.Cruising returns smaller, shorter and on saleBefore the pandemic, it was fairly easy to find a deal on a big ship. Now it's hard to find a big ship. While waiting for safety protocols to be issued that would allow them to resume sailing from U.S. ports, some cruise lines are coming up with a workaround by starting service in the Caribbean. This includes the Celebrity Millennium from Celebrity Cruises, which will offer weeklong sailings from St. Maarten, June 5 through Aug. 21. The 2,218-passenger ship will be limited to 40 percent, or 887 guests who have been vaccinated. (Children under 18 will need a negative test result.)Cruises visit three islands — Aruba, Curaçao and Barbados, or Tortola, St. Lucia and Barbados — and start at $1,999, roughly equivalent to previous trips. But this year, the fare includes round-trip airfare, drinks, Wi-Fi and gratuities.Celestyal Cruises plans to resume sailing in the Greek Islands and the Eastern Mediterranean from Athens beginning May 29. Passengers on the ship — which normally takes 900 and will now book up to 720 guests — must be vaccinated or have proof of a negative Covid test.Bookings for seven-night sailings made by June 30 for travel before July 31 cost $729 a person, a little more than half off; thereafter, departures through August start at $1,019 or about a third off. Rates include drinks, two shore excursions and gratuities.Bucket list trips going once, going twiceMany travel companies aim to trigger your wanderlust by dangling rare bucket-list bargains.The adventure outfitter MT Sobek is offering its 11-day Galápagos trips aboard the 16-passenger yacht Integrity in November and six other departures in 2022 starting at $8,695 a person, $1,000 off the usual price. (A negative Covid-19 test is required of travelers arriving in Ecuador.)If the Amazon rainforest is on your list, check out the 26-room, three-cabin Sacha Lodge in Ecuador on a 5,000-acre preserve. It is offering 25 percent off through June 30 for trips through year-end. A four-day itinerary, including meals and activities such as canopy walks and a night safari by canoe, starts at $1,190 a person prediscount.In Africa, Singita, which runs a collection of safari camps and lodges, has a range of offers throughout most of 2021. At its rebuilt Singita Sabora Tented Camp in Tanzania (open to Americans), its four-nights-for-the-price-of-three sale brings the all-inclusive nightly rate to $1,275 a person, from $1,700.Sixteen African Bush Camps in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe (all open to American travelers) are waiving the single supplement for travel in 2021 on bookings made by April 30. That means a solo traveler would pay $3,794 on a six-night trip in the Mana Pool region of Zimbabwe, saving $1,855.For a change of climate, head to the south coast of Iceland, which is open to vaccinated travelers. There, the Hotel Ranga is offering the seventh night free on weeklong stays, including breakfast and your choice of an activity — a trip to hot springs or an ice cave — between June 1 and Sept. 30 (from 3,084 euros, or about $3,608, for two).Recently, Amtrak was offering trips for as low as $19 on certain U.S. routes in the Northeast. Alas, that sale has ended, but train lovers looking for more ambitious trips can still find deals. Within the United States, take a swing through four national parks with Amtrak Vacations, the tour operator for the train company, which is offering $200 to $500 off several itineraries. Book by April 30 for travel through 2022 to get the nine-day trip from Denver to Salt Lake City from $3,998 for two before a $400 discount, including travel by train, hotel overnights and tours of four parks.Is Greece the new Italy?With most of Italy on lockdown at least through Easter (and currently closed to Americans), Mediterranean lovers are being tempted to Greece, which may reopen to vaccinated and Covid-negative travelers in mid-May.Resorts there are unfurling the welcome mat in the form of deals. Through April, Katikies, which has seven boutique hotels between the islands of Mykonos and Santorini, is offering 20 percent off rates and 100-euro (about $118) food and beverage credits for three-night-minimum stays throughout 2021, including a full refund in case a pandemic-related travel ban is in place. Prediscount, rates at the Katikies Garden Santorini start at 310 euros.On Crete, guests staying five nights or more at the new Cretan Malia Park can book the History Package to get daily breakfast and dinner and a guided tour to Knossos archaeological site followed by lunch at a local tavern. Rates start at $250 a night.Savings on the slopesAnnual ski pass offers usually start low and end, by the time the resorts open, higher, giving skiers and riders incentive to think snow in summer. This year, Vail Resorts is piling on pressure by slashing its Epic Passes by 20 percent, bringing fares back down to 2015-2016 season prices.Right now, an Epic Pass is $783, down from $979 last season, offering access to more than 70 resorts worldwide, including unlimited access to 37 ski areas like Vail and Breckenridge in Colorado and Park City, Utah. By comparison, a one-day lift ticket at Vail currently costs $219.Vail has not said if the price for the pass will rise. The competing Ikon Pass, on sale now at $999, offers access to 44 destinations during the 2021-2022 season and seven for most of the remainder of this year's spring skiing season.What about vacation rentals?Vacation homes have been a relative bright spot in the travel industry during the pandemic, as travelers sought the privacy and control of rental homes. AirDNA, which analyzes the short-term rental market, says prices have been creeping up in early 2021, especially in rural areas and resort locations; average daily rates were up more than nine percent in February 2021 compared to the same period last year.Sitewide sales on rental platforms are rare, but AvantStay, which has more than 400 properties in the United States and Mexico, is offering $250 off bookings from June 20 to Sept. 22 using the booking code SUMMER250.TurnKey Vacation Rentals, which manages more than 6,000 vacation homes around the United States, has a spring deal at 10 percent off stays of seven nights or more.

This article is part of T's Book Club, a series of articles and events dedicated to classic works of American literature. Click here to R.S.V.P. to a virtual conversation about "The Talented Mr. Ripley," to be led by Edmund White and held on April 22.Toward the end of her life, in a 1987 interview with Terry Gross, Patricia Highsmith denied what a biography of Alfred Hitchcock claimed the director had once said to her about his 1951 adaptation of her novel "Strangers on a Train" — namely, that she should pay him for making the film, since it would have a great effect on her career. "No," Highsmith scoffed, her voice husky from the many cigarettes and martinis to which she was partial. "I never had such a personal conversation with Mr. Hitchcock." Still, Hitchcock's film catapulted Highsmith to new heights. It also kicked off a long tradition of her work being adapted for the screen that would continue well after her death, in 1995. Today, there are at least 20 adaptations for film and television based on Highsmith's novels and stories — not including Showtime's forthcoming "Ripley" series, starring Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning. There are many reasons Highsmith's psychological thrillers lend themselves so well to cinema. They are suspenseful and dramatic, frequently set in glamorous locations (the Amalfi coast, Rome, Paris). Throughout, there is often a strong current of sexual tension (Highsmith herself was a lesbian) and an expressed desire to belong to the world of the wealthy and elite. Her characters are also granted charm, uncanny intelligence and first-rate seduction skills, as well as murderous urges, and are thus as villainous as they are entrancing. But Highsmith perhaps knew best what fiction could accomplish better than any movie, asserting: "What I can do in the way of words to show the internal workings of a person's mind cannot be done in film." Though the results vary, her writing has undoubtedly given directors plenty to work with. Here, an examination of four cinematic interpretations — good and bad — of Highsmith's books.VideoThe trailer for the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock film "Strangers on a Train.""Strangers on a Train" (1951)Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers on a Train" (1950)Director: Alfred HitchcockScreenplay: Raymond Chandler, Czenzi Ormonde; adaptation by Whitfield CookStarring: Farley Granger, Robert Walker, Ruth RomanOn a New York-bound train, socialite Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) tells tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) that he admires "people who do things" because he never seems "to do anything." Bruno does, however, concoct a scheme to swap murders with his new acquaintance: He will kill Guy's cheating not-yet-ex-wife, Miriam, thus freeing Guy to marry his new love, Anne (Ruth Roman). Guy, in turn, will kill Bruno's much-loathed father. Both, Bruno promises, will get away with their respective crimes because no one will suspect them: Neither has a discernible motive. Disembarking the train (but fatefully forgetting his engraved cigarette lighter, which Bruno will eventually use to blackmail him), Guy laughs the scheme off, dismissing Bruno as crazy. He assumes that's the end of it.Of course, it's just the beginning. Bruno finds and strangles Miriam. Naturally, Guy, as the estranged husband, is the police's prime suspect; Bruno exploits this predicament in his concerted efforts to force Guy's hand to murder his father in exchange. Various aural, visual and sartorial clues tell us that Bruno's attraction to Guy is fueled as much, if not more, by Eros as by Thanatos. Bruno is a gossipy mama's boy who is fond of tailored suits and silk robes. The queer subtext is barely below the surface — just far enough to get past Hollywood's Hays Code censors of the day. And Granger and Walker's onscreen chemistry is palpable.Strangers though Guy and Bruno might be, Hitchcock reminds us from the outset (and through every plot twist and turn) that they are also doppelgängers. His visual and verbal play with doubling is delightfully hyperbolic. In the first few minutes of the film, there are two sets of legs and shoes, two taxis, two porters, train tracks that crisscross twice — such examples proliferate throughout the film and are echoed in Hitchcock's use of reflections, crosscutting and dissolves, which further emphasize the extent to which Bruno and Guy are forcefully and inextricably connected.There is less murder but more mayhem in Hitchcock's adaptation of Highsmith's novel. The film is also more expansive, existential and contemplative. Where the book has just one major amusement park scene (in which Miriam is murdered), the film adds a second as the site of its chaotic climax (the merry-go-round runs amok, killing Bruno) and denouement (the police discover Guy's lighter in Bruno's dead hand, proving that Bruno is the culprit). Guy is ultimately exonerated. The film concludes by mirroring its beginning but adds a humorous touch: Guy and Anne exchange glances before switching train cars to avoid a kindly stranger who recognizes them.There are no such light touches in Highsmith's novel, in which both men are murderers. Guy (here an architect, not a tennis star) succumbs to Bruno's pressure and murders Bruno's father precisely as instructed (in the film, he tries to warn the father that his son is a maniac). Later, Bruno dies in a boating accident and Guy, racked with guilt, confesses. If Hitchcock's moral vision is as black-and-white as his cinematography, the novel paints exclusively in shades of gray, reveling in moral and ethical ambiguities. Highsmith's vision is less sensational and, as a result, more sinister. Hitchcock's characters are either good or evil; Highsmith reminds us that everyone is both at once, and that anyone could be capable of murder."Carol" (2015)Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's "The Price of Salt," published in 1952 under the pseudonym Claire MorganDirector: Todd HaynesScreenplay: Phyllis NagyStarring: Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Kyle ChandlerDepartment store salesgirl and photographer Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) is instantly enthralled by a new customer, the wealthy (almost) divorcée Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett). The pair embark on a friendship turned romance that irrevocably alters both their lives. Lesbians everywhere hold their breath until the film's end: Here, neither woman is killed off or declared insane — rare in most Hollywood depictions of queer female love. Moreover, the novel and its film adaptation give them a refreshingly hopeful conclusion. This love affair just might stand the test of time.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/3:17-0:00transcriptAnatomy of a Scene ' 'Carol'Todd Haynes narrates a sequence from the film. Todd Haynes narrates a sequence from the film.CreditCredit...Wilson Webb/The Weinstein CompanyIn director Todd Haynes's hands, though, everyone is domesticated. "Carol" refuses its characters their original sharp angles and dark corners. Haynes's Carol transforms from the novel's exceedingly confident, often cold, sometimes calculating protagonist into a soft, yearning and ultimately martyr-like mother. Her ex-husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), is rendered too sympathetically: He hovers and beseeches where in the novel he schemes and withholds. We witness film Harge fixing a pipe under the sink in the house to which he desperately longs to return, declaring his love for Carol in multiple scenes and looking anguished by Carol's sacrifice in granting him full custody of their daughter, Rindy. Highsmith's Harge isn't given that much time or attention: His attachment to Carol is expressed predominantly as possessive patriarchal entitlement and an ego-driven desire to save face.Film Carol sips tea and decorates the Christmas tree; she wraps presents and fusses over her daughter. In an anticlimactic scene that feels more like a slumber party than the exciting beginning of a night of seduction, Carol gives Therese a … makeover. And while we know their feelings run deeper than friendship, this isn't because of any great chemistry between the two leads, which is sadly lacking, save during their (yes, hot) sex. Conversely, novel Carol is alluringly opaque. Rarely without a drink or cigarette in hand, she declines to reassure Therese about her feelings or their future.While Haynes uses hands as a gorgeous leitmotif in "Carol" — giving them many lingering close-ups — they don't do as much as they do in the novel. There, Therese is an assured and ambitious set designer ready to make her mark in the field; she's a builder of fantastic worlds. But in the film, she is an insecure photographer who documents rather than creates scenes; her novelistic counterpart simply could not afford such a career. The stark class (and age) differences between Therese and Carol are salient and profound plot points in the book. The film confronts them less directly.Made more than 60 years after the novel was published, the film reflects surprisingly conservative choices about its characters, making them out to be simpler and ostensibly more palatable at every turn. Film Therese is even a virgin, whereas novel Therese is having (unsatisfying) sex with her putative boyfriend, Richard. The hard, fierce underplay of emotions and issues that Highsmith so carefully wrought is here treated like (unsalted) butter on the counter, left to soften until easily spread."A Kind of Murder" (2016)Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's "The Blunderer" (1954)Director: Andy GoddardScreenplay: Susan BoydStarring: Patrick Wilson, Jessica Biel, Eddie Marsan, Vincent Kartheiser"A Kind of Murder" is kind of a terrible film — a noir thriller with no teeth, unless you count Vincent Kartheiser (as Detective Corby) chewing the scenery. Kartheiser's hokey, overzealous acting embodies all that doesn't work here. The film turns psychologically complex characters into one-dimensional caricatures, and Highsmith's nuance, suspense and tension — which manage to create claustrophobic worlds in wide-open spaces — are nowhere to be found. Heavy-handedness does not help director Andy Goddard's cause: He's about as subtle as the ubiquitous, lurid reds (curtains, walls, bedspreads) that color the film's depiction of 1960s New York. We get it: Someone has blood on his hands.Walter Stackhouse (Patrick Wilson) is unhappily married to a neurotic, paranoid and icy real estate agent named Clara (Jessica Biel), whom he finally decides to divorce. When Clara turns up dead under a bridge near Harry's Rainbow Grill, Corby is convinced Stackhouse killed her; moreover, he's sure Stackhouse has followed in the footsteps of local bookstore owner Marty Kimmel (Eddie Marsan), whose wife, Helen, was recently found murdered at the same location. Copycat or coincidence? In the novel, Kimmel has brutally murdered his cheating wife, Helen, by the end of the first chapter, making Stackhouse's obsession with this story and his repeated visits to Kimmel's shop compellingly suspect, even hinting at possible collusion. Is Kimmel Stackhouse's murderous mentor? In the film, we don't know for sure that Kimmel is guilty until a flashback much later in the plot shows him committing the crime, and so the encounters between the strangers come off as decidedly less fraught. Stackhouse's fascination with Kimmel — he just can't keep his distance — isn't quite earned here.In the novel, Stackhouse is a lawyer and amateur writer working on a book of essays titled "Unworthy Friendships," whose thesis is that most people maintain friendships with at least one person inferior to themselves. He happily writes for his own pleasure, not caring whether the work is published. Film Stackhouse is an architect and amateur writer of crime fiction (inspired by true stories he clips from newspapers) who's eager for a byline. In theory, this metafictional angle is rife with possibilities; in practice, however, it's a rather moot plot point. Aside from close-ups of Stackhouse banging out provocative, potentially revealing text on his typewriter, the film does nothing with it. This feels like a missed opportunity to say more about the slippery relationship between fact and fiction and the potentially dangerous allure of true crime.As a title, "The Blunderer" is wonderfully onomatopoeic; it's also a phrase that refers predominantly but not exclusively to Stackhouse, as he commits error after error in the wake of Clara's death; his attempts to prove his innocence continue to implicate him and his life spirals out of control. He loses his friends, his job, his new girlfriend and more. We never learn whether Stackhouse is guilty in either the novel or the film. But in Highsmith's hands, this ambiguity satisfies, because her blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality is thought-provoking and profound."The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999)Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1955)Director: Anthony MinghellaScreenplay: Anthony MinghellaStarring: Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Philip Seymour HoffmanEarly on in the film, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) declares that "everybody should have one talent" and asks Tom Ripley (Matt Damon): "What's yours?" Without missing a beat, and in one of many sharp departures from Highsmith's novel, Tom responds, "Forging signatures, telling lies, impersonating practically anybody." Why does the con man admit to being a con man? Is it just another part of the trick — or a genuine attempt to be seen for who he really is? Director Anthony Minghella's choice to highlight this passage from the book amplifies, rather than flattens, Highsmith's themes; this is the real achievement of his gorgeous adaptation.In Minghella's world, Tom already plays many parts — he stands in for a piano player at a fancy party; he's caught taking the stage after hours at the concert hall where he's employed as a lavatory attendant. Minghella shows Tom working hard, whereas in the novel, he is resentful of having to do so. Film Tom studies up before his trip to Italy to bring Dickie home (at the behest and expense of Dickie's father) — he learns about jazz to forge common ground with the rich and cultured Dickie (here an amateur musician rather than painter). While the movie omits Tom's upbringing with a horribly homophobic Aunt Dottie, on whom he's begrudgingly dependent, it also shows Tom to be a sympathetic working-class striver. "I always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody," he explains.If film Tom is more sympathetic than his novel equivalent, some of his victims, Dickie and Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are less so — they are mean and bullying snobs who ridicule Tom's lack of wealth and worldliness, excluding him from their group trip because he doesn't know how to ski. They are also eminently more disposable, and as a result their deaths are not as shocking or sad. Film Dickie is engaged to Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) while also carrying on with a pregnant Italian lover who dies by suicide. In the novel, Marge's love for Dickie is unrequited and a little pathetic. Still, both versions capture what Tom can never earn for himself: the cruel sense of entitlement that comes with privilege.The film aggressively tries to socialize Tom, giving him a flirtatious relationship with an heiress named Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), a companionable vibe with Marge (completely absent in the novel, where she's his stark antagonist) and, toward the end, even a loving, attentive boyfriend, Peter (whom, yes, he must kill so as not to be caught for impersonating Dickie). The novel's Tom is singular, solitary, alone in a crowd — seemingly only alive when his impressions and actions are viewed positively in the eyes of others.The opening credits offer a roulette wheel of adjectives ("mysterious," "troubled," "yearning," "secretive," "lonely," "gifted," "confused," "loving," "intelligent," "haunted," etc.) before landing on "talented." Damon's portrayal of the title character — which calls for him to embody all these traits simultaneously — is convincingly nuanced. His Tom is drawn to and tortured by the sundry selves he encounters and creates, at one point riding a moped down an alley of mirrors that seem to taunt him, until he crashes. Of course, one of the mirrors shatters, and he sees himself in the same fragmented manner that we do."The Talented Mr. Ripley" is arguably the best and most renowned adaptation of any Highsmith work to date owing to the superb cast — everyone is so eminently watchable — and to Minghella's care with his source material. As any filmmaker must, he adds and subtracts details, but he never sacrifices Highsmith's smooth surfaces or the depths that they only occasionally disguise.Kerry Manders is a writer, editor and photographer whose personal work focuses on queer memory and mourning.

The terrible human and economic cost of the pandemic cannot be ignored. It has forced many people to test the limits of their creativity and endurance. And maybe, for a lucky unburdened few, all that time at home has provided an opportunity to explore new interests.It may have been cooking or knitting. Sales of guitars shot upward in 2020 as people found relief in playing music. Or maybe you discovered that you love wine, and you have become curious enough to want to learn more about it.Many great books can help to broaden your knowledge, yet with wine, the best way to begin the journey is by drinking. Whether you prefer to do that systematically or randomly is up to you. But whichever you decide, you'll want just a few tools to enhance the experience.Let me explain that. You really don't need anything to enjoy wine short of a corkscrew (you don't even need that if the bottle has a screw cap) and a glass (no, do not drink wine out of the bottle unless you've just won the World Series). But while those are the bare essentials, a few practical items will heighten your enjoyment.This starter kit is simple. You need wine glasses, a corkscrew, a decanter and, of course, some wine. Later, you can add to your equipment. (Fair warning: It has the potential to become a money pit.) But initially, if you choose wisely, the investment will be small. The potential for pleasure, though, is great. Here is what you need to get started.CorkscrewYou cannot drink wine without opening the bottle (unless you have a boxed wine). Though screw caps are welcome and easy additions to the range of wine closures, most bottles are still stoppered with a cork. For that you need a corkscrew.This is an easy selection. Forget about your Swiss Army knife or the double-winged man whose arms you squeeze together to extract the cork. The single best corkscrew is what you've seen in countless restaurants, sometimes called the waiter's friend. It's essentially a knifelike handle with a spiral worm for inserting into the cork, a double-hinged fulcrum for resistance and a small, folding blade for cutting the foil that protects the cork.This sort of corkscrew, which was deemed the top choice a few years ago by Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, is compact and inexpensive, $10 or $12 or so. Wine shops often carry them, as do many online markets. It pays to buy a few if, like me, you habitually misplace them. With a bit of practice, it is easy to use.Wine GlassesYou need a vessel for drinking the wine. Good stemmed glasses are essential equipment.It's tempting to think of stemmed glasses as fussy. What's the point? You've been to bars or restaurants, perhaps, that serve wine in tumblers, and that works well enough. Many companies now offer stemless glasses, too.Don't succumb to the temptation. You can relish a wine served in a squat juice glass, but you will enjoy it even more drinking it out of a proper stemmed glass.Good wine is sensitive to temperature. Both white wine and red needs to be served cool, certainly cooler than the temperature of your body. A stemless glass requires you to hold it by the bowl, thus transmitting the heat of your hands to the glass, warming it and the wine.That is the reason good wine glasses have a stem. The proper way to hold a wine glass is by the stem so that you don't heat up the bowl.This may seem pretentious. Wine drinkers in popular culture often hold their wine glasses by the bowl, by design, I suspect, to avoid appearing pompous to the audience.If you grab a wine glass by the bowl, it's not the end of the world. Those who gasp in dismay prove themselves to be the snobs. Ideally, you want to make use of the built-in functionality of the glass. So try holding it by the stem.It's worth taking the trouble to do this for another reason, too. The color of good wine is both beautiful and revealing. Over time, you will learn to discern some important characteristics of the wine. A white wine may get darker over time, or if it has oxidized. A red wine, by contrast, may lighten around the edges as it ages. Holding the bowl with your fingers smudges the glass, obscuring the clarity of the wine.To assess the wine, the glass needs to be clear, not colored, beveled or otherwise decorated in such a way that blocks your view.Choosing a glass is a lot simpler than you might think. For one thing, you need only one set. While the wine industry, and especially glass manufacturers, have promoted the notion that each sort of wine requires its own specially designed glass — not just red, white and sparkling, but pinot noir, cabernet sauvignon, riesling and so on — the truth is that one set of all-purpose glasses will serve you well.Good all-purpose glasses ought to be vertically shaped with a tall bowl that is wide at the stem and tapers gently inward toward the lip. This shape channels aromas upward, amplifying them as you swirl and sniff.You've probably seen many wine lovers swirling the glass before they sniff. I do it habitually, believing that the action increases the wine's exposure to air and activates the aromas. Chances are you will be doing this before long, too.To avoid sloshing yourself with wine, good glasses need to be large enough to hold a decent amount when filled one-third of the way up.A few years ago I joined some colleagues at Wirecutter to review wine glasses. We concluded the best all-around value in wine glasses was the Libbey Kentfield Estate Signature All-Purpose, which sells for $35 to $40 for a set of four.Last December, Wirecutter revisited wine glasses and reaffirmed the selection of the Libbey. That's a pretty good endorsement. They are not the only possibility, but they offer a good example of a well-shaped, all-purpose glass.How many will you need? What's your style of entertaining? I know the pandemic has us all out of practice, but I think eight is a pretty good number for a start.Good wine glasses are not fragile. Don't hesitate to put them in a dishwasher, though of course you should be careful how you position them.One more point: Despite the long tradition of using special glasses like flutes, tulips or coupes for Champagne and other sparkling wines, many wine professionals and I prefer ordinary wine glasses, which better show off the beauty, aromas and flavors.Nonetheless, because sparkling wine is so often opened for celebratory occasions, use these stylish glasses if you think they more clearly convey a sense of ceremony. Sometimes style wins out over functionality.DecanterA decanter is not essential. But it's useful, simple and can enhance youthful wines by opening up their aromas and flavors by exposing the wine to air.What is decanting? It simply means to pour the wine from the bottle into another container before serving. Many people assume decanting is only useful for older red wines, which might accumulate sediment over the course of long aging. But I like to decant young wines, too, both white and red, particularly those that might be high in acidity or tannins. I definitely do not always decant. But I like to do it occasionally.You can spend a lot of money on fancy decanters. That's unnecessary. An iced-tea pitcher works great, so long as it is big enough to comfortably hold the contents of a 750-milliliter bottle. At home I use one-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, which have a certain mad-scientist charm to them.Things to AvoidWine abounds in useless gadgets: Advertisements tout the virtues of aerators, which purport to age your wine in a matter of seconds, and similarly magical wands, said to eliminate the possibility of headaches. Save your money.You will also encounter pumps, closures and other tools said to protect a partly consumed bottle of wine from spoiling. Avoid them, too.Good wine — by which I mean carefully made, not expensive — is much hardier than people think. You can safely leave unfinished wine in the bottle for two or three days. Just put the bottle someplace cool and out of the sunlight.The WineAll of this paraphernalia would be useless without wine. If you are investing in the proper equipment, you also need to commit to serving good wine, made from conscientiously farmed grapes and painstaking winemaking.The single best way to achieve this goal is to develop a relationship with the best wine shop in your vicinity. Unlike supermarkets and the equivalent, which generally sell popular brands regardless of quality, good wine shops carefully select their inventory, picking wines that they can stand behind.How can you tell if a shop is good? It will be hospitable, its inventory will reflect a point of view and the wine will be well stored and displayed. Generally, it will be a place that makes you comfortable, that you want to visit.In selecting wine, the best values are most often in the $15 to $25 range. Some wines, particularly the most famous names, will be more expensive. You will have to pay more for a good Champagne, Barolo or Napa Valley cabernet. But plenty of great, less expensive bottles exist.The best way to start out, once you identify a good shop, is to ask for a mixed case of wine. Tell the merchant your budget and parameters, say, half white, half red, with two sparkling wines, or a few rosés. Or, if a case is too much of an investment, just get a bottle or two at a time. As you drink the wines, note which ones you like and which ones you do not. Keep in mind that you can learn something from every bottle as you begin to identify your personal taste.When you finish, go back to the merchant with your notes, and ask for another mixed case with selections based on your reactions to the first set. Your learning journey has begun. As long as you continue to love wine, it will never end.Future ConsiderationsAs your interest deepens, you may want to augment your equipment. You might want to buy better, more beautiful glassware, for example, or raise your budget on wine purchases.If you begin to accumulate bottles, you need to consider wine storage, especially if you are buying bottles to age. Nothing is worse than investing in good bottles and aging them for years only to see them spoiled because of poor storage. The solution depends partly on your living situation.If your house has a cool, dark, tranquil basement, you are in luck. Throw some shelves in a corner, add bottles and let them sit. If you are in an apartment or don't have a basement, you might want to consider a wine refrigerator, a unit intended for wine bottles that keeps them cool, generally somewhere from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.Wirecutter offers some excellent advice on choosing a fridge. Two things are important to know right away. First, buy the best one you can afford. You are entrusting your wine to this device, and you don't want it to fail you. Second, go big. No matter what size fridge you buy, chances are you will outgrow it before long.Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

"The very existence of this film is a miracle," Raoul Peck says in "Exterminate All the Brutes," a documentary he wrote, directed and narrated. He's referring to the existence of a film that retells the history of colonialism and slavery from a nonwhite, non-Western viewpoint, though in 2021 that may seem less like a miracle than an expectation.What's more miraculous is that Peck found a home on mainstream American television — yes, it's HBO, but still — for a supremely personal, impressionistic yet intellectualized, four-hour cascade of images, ruminations and historical aperçus. (The busy editor was Alexandra Strauss.) That would be an impressive achievement on any subject, let alone genocide.The title "Exterminate All the Brutes," with its combination of blunt force and literary flourish (and its suggestion that history has misidentified the real brutes), is appropriate to a project that elaborates on and aestheticizes feelings of outrage, disbelief and despair. (It was taken from Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" and from a 1996 book by the historian Sven Lindqvist that is one of several scholarly sources Peck drew on.)The film, whose four chapters premiere Wednesday and Thursday nights, is unrelenting in its critique, but it's also more muted in tone than that title might suggest. Peck's slightly droning narration contributes to that effect, as does an approach that's more free-associative than truly essayistic. There's also, unfortunately, the documentary's tendency to cycle through and circle around a relatively small set of ideas that would have had more force in a shorter film.If "Exterminate All the Brutes" is never boring, it's less because Peck — whose James Baldwin documentary, "I Am Not Your Negro," was an Oscar nominee in 2017 — always gives you something new to think about than because he always gives you something new to look at.In addition to the expected archival images from centuries of colonial depredation, the film incorporates animated historical recreations; snazzy graphics; copious clips from Hollywood depictions of non-Western populations; photos and home movies from Peck's childhood in Haiti, Africa and New York City; and fictional scenes featuring Josh Hartnett as the stolid face of white supremacy, in various times and places. (All colonialists look alike.)Peck's story focuses on the entwined threads of the genocide of North America's Indigenous people and the enslavement of Africans, and on the links he finds between those horrors and other genocides and oppressions, particularly the Holocaust. There are things in his account that will probably be new for many viewers, like the discussion of the Spanish priest Bartolomé de las Casas and his role in the fates of both Indigenous people in the Americas and African slaves, or the way Peck restores the Haitian revolution to its rightful stature alongside the American and French revolutions.But much of the material in "Exterminate All the Brutes" is familiar; it has been known all along, a circumstance that Peck acknowledges and that fuels his anger."The educated general public has always largely known what atrocities have been committed and are being committed in the name of progress, civilization, socialism, democracy and the market," he says. The question is why they have been ignored, obfuscated and whitewashed in popular culture.Peck's broad assertions and arguments aren't likely to generate a lot of controversy, though his repeated linking of the histories of the American West and African colonialism to the Holocaust (allowing for a lot of Hitler footage) might strike some as facile or insensitive.In his attempt to replace the traditional narratives about Indigenous and other oppressed peoples with his own storytelling, though, some strategies are less successful than others. The fictional sequences may be Peck's most direct attempt to redress history — Hartnett enacts shooting a Seminole woman in the head in one scene, and in another is bathed by an African woman near a grouping of lynched corpses — but their art-house staginess and solemnity serve only to distance us from what we're seeing. (It's also noticeable that women are not often seen or heard from in the film, except as silent victims.)A work that "Exterminate All the Brutes" calls to mind, and which seems almost certain to have been an inspiration for it — in both theme and technique — is Chris Marker's great film essay "Sans Soleil," from 1983. But Peck's documentary is more polemical and less poetic than Marker's; it constantly makes connections, but it feels more didactic than complex, more academic than allusive.(The rush of often violent or disturbing imagery sometimes calls to mind a very different film, the 1962 Italian shock-doc "Mondo Cane.")Peck sprinkles the four hours with images of and references to recent American presidents, and in the final chapter he lands full force in the present day, comparing Donald Trump and other heads of state with the white, Western overlords of the colonial era.But throughout "Exterminate All the Brutes," the specific drifts into the general and the historical into the personal without, perhaps, the effect that Peck is hoping for. He closes with a reproving phrase that echoes through the film: "It's not knowledge we lack." But he declines to say what it is we lack — compassion? Willpower? If there is something we possess that could have made history different, either he doesn't know or he's not telling.

They call it a "sleeper": With a starting price of just $1,800, a potentially undervalued old master painting was pulled from auction and is now thought to be worth millions.A sale of art and antiques at the Madrid auction house Ansorena on Thursday was scheduled to include a grimy oil on canvas of Christ being crowned with thorns, cataloged as from the "circle" of the 17th-century Spanish painter José de Ribera. The suggested starting bid was set at 1,500 euros, or about $1,800. The Museo del Prado in Madrid, which had become aware that this painting might be a long-lost work by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, the most celebrated of all Baroque artists, alerted Spain's culture ministry. And on Wednesday, the ministry announced an export ban on the painting, and it was withdrawn from the auction the following day."About the authorship, the different experts are studying the work right now," said Belén Puente Herrero, the director of communications at Ansorena, who declined to provide further details about the painting and its ownership.Two weeks ago, the painting was spotted online by the London-based old master dealers Marco Voena and Fabrizio Moretti, who flew to Madrid to view the work in person. They believe it to be a well-documented but long-lost Caravaggio."When I saw it, it went 'boom,'" said Voena, speaking in a phone interview from Madrid. "It's Caravaggio, completely. It's incredible. It has great power." He added that the painting was owned by a "normal family" and that he had offered to negotiate a private sale to a Spanish museum for a "small commission," but the auction house had yet to respond.In 2017, Voena and Moretti bought a newly discovered self-portrait by Caravaggio's renowned contemporary Artemisia Gentileschi for 2.4 million euros with fees, or about $2.8 million, at a Paris auction. The dealers later sold it to the National Gallery in London.If the painting does prove to be a fully accepted Caravaggio, the Museo del Prado in Madrid, whose collection at the moment contains just one work by the artist, would be a logical new home."At this moment no one at El Prado has seen the painting personally," said Carlos Chaguaceda, the communications director at the museum. "Nevertheless we consider that it deserves a deep study as soon as possible."The subject, from St. John's Gospel, shows Pontius Pilate presenting the scourged and mocked Christ to the crowd. According to contemporary biographers, Caravaggio participated in a secret competition with two other painters to make a canvas of this scene, known as "Ecce Homo." Caravaggio's entry was reputedly taken to Spain. A painting of this subject is displayed as a Caravaggio at the Galleria Palazzo Rosso in Genoa, but the attribution has been disputed by some scholars.Maria Cristina Terzaghi, an associate professor of art history at Roma Tre University in Rome, is among the scholars who believes that the painting withdrawn from the Madrid sale is Caravaggio's original "Ecce Homo.""There is no doubt about the attribution," said Terzaghi, who flew to Madrid on Tuesday to view the work in person.Terzaghi said that the canvas matched the description and size of corresponding Caravaggio works listed in two 17th-century collectors' inventories, and that the figure of Pilate was based on a model who appears in another Caravaggio work, the "Madonna of the Rosary," now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.Terzaghi said she thinks the painting was made in Naples around 1606. She added that the canvas had suffered from some paint losses and discoloration, and was "not in very good condition.""The problem is the provenance," said Terzaghi, who pointed out that the painting disappears from documentation in the mid-17th century. "There are holes in the story which we need to clarify."The value of the painting is also a matter for clarification. The last major painting to be offered on the market as a Caravaggio was a newly discovered canvas of "Judith and Holofernes" scheduled to be sold at auction Toulouse in 2019. Estimated at €100 million to €150 million, the painting was withdrawn shortly before the sale and bought privately by the New York-based collector J. Tomilson Hill for a price closer to the reserve of €30 million. Scholars were divided over whether it was painted solely by Caravaggio.As this latest possible rediscovery now cannot leave Spain, we will not know what it would have made if it were accepted as a Caravaggio and was offered on the international market.But Anthony Crichton-Stuart, a former Christie's specialist who is now director of the dealer Agnew's, a London gallery, can hazard a guess. "If it were offered on the open market, and it had full support from a majority of scholars, I think it would be worth at least €50 million," said Crichton-Stuart — nearly $60 million. "But how long is a piece of string?"

Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.On the first evening in April, Sara Krulwich, a New York Times photographer, visited the Kraine Theater in the East Village, where Mike Daisey, an actor and monologuist, was rehearsing a show for which the seating capacity would be limited to 22. The restriction, Mr. Daisey said, reminded him of his earliest days as a performer, when he was thrilled if even a handful of people were in the audience.For about 20 minutes, Ms. Krulwich photographed Mr. Daisey, adjusting her shutter, she later said, to ensure that "the theater lights and my camera were going to talk to each other in a kindly way."The next day, Ms. Krulwich photographed part of a performance at the Daryl Roth Theater at Union Square. And on Saturday, she shot a 36-minute performance at the historic St. James Theater in Midtown. Those assignments added up to her busiest stretch of theater work in more than a year.Theatrical productions, dormant since last spring, are resuming in New York City, the first tentative steps toward what actors, directors and others hope will be a strong comeback by the fall. And many in the theater world may see Ms. Krulwich's presence as a reassuring sign.For more than two decades, she has been a Broadway and Off Broadway fixture, photographing about 100 shows a year, a body of work that led to her receiving a Tony Honor in 2018. After a yearlong absence, Ms. Krulwich began photographing performances and rehearsals, feeling her way back into familiar tasks and reflecting on early traces of a theatrical revival, which, she said, mirrored the stirrings of spring."The blooms are beginning," she said by phone. "Even if we're not seeing the full flowering just yet."Ms. Krulwich joined The Times as a staff photographer in 1979, working for the Metro, National and Sports desks before becoming the paper's first culture photographer in 1994.At that time, she said, it was common for news organizations to run theater photographs handed out by producers that tended to present reality in the light most favorable to them. Ms. Krulwich, however, wanted to cover theater with the same journalistic approach that the paper employed while reporting on other events.The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETPfizer and BioNTech requested the F.D.A.'s authorization to use their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination.Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations.Ms. Krulwich said that her approach was direct, telling producers that theater was looked upon as news inside The Times and should be documented that way. Eventually, she obtained access to almost every production in the city.Over the years, Ms. Krulwich has captured moments that have become a part of theater lore. She photographed developmental work on the Broadway production of Tony Kushner's masterwork, "Angels in America." In 1996, she took what is believed to be the last picture of Jonathan Larson, the writer and composer of "Rent," hours before his death the night before the show's first Off Broadway preview.Her Tony, in 2018, made her the first journalist recognized for excellence in the theater, an honor given to people, organizations and institutions that have contributed to the industry but are not eligible to win in other Tony categories.Returning to work inside venues she's accustomed to, Ms. Krulwich said she took delight in seeing people she has known for many years and looked forward to a time when everyone connected to productions will, once again, be able to make a living."It's a small group of people," she said. "Almost an extended family."The day after photographing Mr. Daisey, Ms. Krulwich wore an N-95 mask and climbed a ladder at the Daryl Roth while shooting about 20 minutes of a performance of "Blindness," an audio adaptation of the dystopian novel of the same name by the Portuguese writer José Saramago.And then, the following day, at the St. James, she photographed the dancer Savion Glover and the actor Nathan Lane at the 36-minute event they performed in front of a masked audience of 150.It was, noted Michael Paulson, a Times theater reporter, the first time in 387 days that there was activity inside a Broadway house.Ms. Krulwich said the performance was not the same as one that would have taken place before the coronavirus pandemic, but she added that she felt at home back inside the St. James and appreciated the hints of what is to come."I must say, it felt familiar to me," she said. "It's just a little bit. It's a tiptoe. It's the doors opening a crack."

Melodine Jeptoo will never forget the first time she saw a locust swarm. Moving like a dark cloud, the insects blotted out the sky and pelted her like hail."When they're flying, they really hit you hard," said Ms. Jeptoo, who lives in Kenya and works with PlantVillage, a nonprofit group that uses technology to help farmers adapt to climate change.In 2020, billions of the insects descended on East African countries that had not seen locusts in decades, fueled by unusual weather connected to climate change. Kenya had last dealt with a plague of this scale more than 70 years ago; Ethiopia and Somalia, more than 30 years ago. Nineteen million farmers and herders across these three countries, which bore the brunt of the damage, saw their livelihoods severely affected."People were operating in the dark, running around with their heads cut off in a panic," said Keith Cressman, a senior locust forecasting officer at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. "They hadn't faced something of this magnitude since the early 1950s."But as bad as 2020's swarms were, they and their offspring could have caused much worse damage. While the weather has helped slow the insects' reproduction, the success, Mr. Cressman said, has primarily resulted from a technology-driven anti-locust operation that hastily formed in the chaotic months following the insects' arrival to East Africa. This groundbreaking approach proved so effective at clamping down on the winged invaders in some places that some experts say it could transform management of other natural disasters around the world."We'd better not let this crisis go to waste," said David Hughes, an entomologist at Penn State University. "We should use this lesson as a way not just to be adapted to the next locust crisis, but to climate change, generally."Desert locusts are the Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes of the insect world. Normally, the grasshopper-like plant eaters spend their time living solitarily across the deserts of North Africa, Southwest Asia and the Middle East. But when rains arrive, they change from a muted brown into a fiery yellow and become gregarious, forming groups of more than 15 million insects per square mile. Such a swarm can consume the equivalent amount of food in a single day as more than 13,000 people.The locust plague that hit East Africa in 2020 was two years in the making. In 2018, two major cyclones dumped rain in a remote area of Saudi Arabia, leading to an 8,000-fold increase in desert locust numbers. By mid-2019, winds had pushed the insects into the Horn of Africa, where a wet autumn further boosted their population. An unusual cyclone in Somalia in early December finally tipped the situation into a true emergency."Ten years ago, there would have been between zero and one cyclones coming off the Indian Ocean," Dr. Hughes said. "Now there's eight to 12 per year — a consequence of climate change."Countries like Sudan and Eritrea that regularly deal with small, seasonal swarms have teams of locust trackers who are trained to find the insects and recognize which life cycle stage they are in. They use a tablet-based program to transmit locust data by satellite to national and international authorities so experts can design appropriate control strategies.But people outside of those frontline locust nations who may want to start using this system today would encounter a typical technology problem: The version of the tablets that the locust-tracking program was written for is no longer manufactured, and newer tablets are not compatible with the software. And even if the hardware were available, in 2020, East Africa lacked experts who could identify locusts."We'd never had a dress rehearsal for the real thing," said Alphonse Owuor, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization specialist in Somalia. "We had people who were very familiar with locusts in theory, but who didn't have the experience or equipment required to carry out this massive operation."With swarms suddenly covering an area of Kenya larger than New Jersey, officials were tasked with creating a locust-combating operation virtually from scratch. Collecting dependable, detailed data about locusts was the first crucial step."Saying 'Oh, there's locusts in northern Kenya' doesn't help at all," Mr. Cressman said. "We need longitude and latitude coordinates in real time."Rather than try to rewrite the locust-tracking software for newer tablets, Mr. Cressman thought it would be more efficient to create a simple smartphone app that would allow anyone to collect data like an expert. He reached out to Dr. Hughes, who had already created a similar mobile tool with the Food and Agriculture Organization to track a devastating crop pest, the fall armyworm, through PlantVillage, which he founded.PlantVillage's app uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help farmers in 60 countries, primarily in Africa, diagnose problems in their fields. Borrowing from this blueprint, Dr. Hughes and his colleagues completed the new app, eLocust3m, in just a month.Unlike the previous tablet-based program, anyone with a smartphone can use eLocust3m. The app presents photos of locusts at different stages of their life cycles, which helps users diagnose what they see in the field. GPS coordinates are automatically recorded and algorithms double check photos submitted with each entry. Garmin International also helped with another program that worked on satellite-transmitting devices."The app is really easy to use," said Ms. Jeptoo of PlantVillage. Last year, she recruited and trained locust trackers in four hard-hit Kenyan regions. "We had scouts who were 40- to 50-year-old elders, and even they were able to use it."In the last year, more than 240,000 locust records have poured in from East Africa, collected by PlantVillage scouts, government-trained personnel and citizens. But that was only the first step. Countries next needed to act on the data in a systematic way to quash locusts. In the first few months, however, officials were strategizing "on the back of envelopes," Mr. Cressman said, and the entire region had just four planes for spraying pesticides.When Batian Craig, director of 51 Degrees, a security and logistics company focused on protecting wildlife, saw Mr. Cressman quoted in a news story about locusts, he realized he could help.Mr. Craig and his colleagues, who are headquartered at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Central Kenya, conduct regular anti-poaching aerial surveys that could be repurposed to seek out and destroy locust swarms. They also closely communicate with rural communities affected by the insects.Additionally, 51 Degrees uses a free program called EarthRanger. Created by Vulcan, a Seattle-based philanthropic company originally co-founded by Paul Allen of Microsoft and his sister Jody Allen, EarthRanger compiles and analyzes geographic data ranging from rhino and ranger locations to sensor data and remote imagery.Engineers at Vulcan agreed to customize a version of EarthRanger for locusts, integrating data from the eLocust programs and the computer loggers on aerial pesticide sprayers.Lewa Conservancy quickly became the headquarters for aerial survey and control across the region. By June 2020, these efforts were paying off. Locusts were prevented from spilling into Africa's Sahel region and west to Senegal."If we didn't stop them, the locusts would have reached Chad, Niger, Mali and Mauritania," said Cyril Ferrand, leader of the F.A.O.'s Eastern Africa resilience team. "We were able to prevent a much bigger catastrophe."The progeny of the 2020 swarms continue to cause damage across East Africa. But now, countries are better able to combat them — equipped with the new technology, 28 aircraft and thousands of trained government locust trackers. In February alone, locust-patrolling pilots in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia flew the equivalent of three times the circumference of the globe. They sprayed swarms before they had time to mature, stopping the insects from multiplying and spreading into Uganda and South Sudan, as they did last year."The situation is still very, very serious," Mr. Cressman said. "But if you compare now to a year ago, the countries are a thousand times more prepared."Since February 2020, the F.A.O. estimates that this effort in East Africa has averted the loss of agricultural products with a commercial value of $1.5 billion — saving the livelihoods of 34 million people."These are big data for a region that's already very fragile," Mr. Ferrand said.The new approach could yield even greater results in tracking, combating and even averting future disasters. Dr. Hughes is now working with experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to use locust reports to build models that will predict future plagues. Such insight would allow countries to implement pre-emptive control strategies that are less environmentally damaging than pesticides.The same approach, Dr. Hughes said, could also be used to combat other climate-related disasters, such as floods, droughts and pest outbreaks."Locusts show how we can crowdsource with artificial intelligence," Dr. Hughes said. "This can be an absolute game-changer to hundreds of millions of people as we adapt to climate change."

"Focus on the sound of the instrument," Andrew Rossetti, a licensed music therapist and researcher said as he strummed hypnotic chords on a Spanish-style classical guitar. "Close your eyes. Think of a place where you feel safe and comfortable."Music therapy was the last thing that Julia Justo, a graphic artist who immigrated to New York from Argentina, expected when she went to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Union Square Clinic for treatment for cancer in 2016. But it quickly calmed her fears about the radiation therapy she needed to go through, which was causing her severe anxiety."I felt the difference right away, I was much more relaxed," she said.Ms. Justo, who has been free of cancer for over four years, continued to visit the hospital every week before the onset of the pandemic to work with Mr. Rossetti, whose gentle guitar riffs and visualization exercises helped her deal with ongoing challenges, like getting a good night's sleep. Nowadays they keep in touch mostly by email.The healing power of music — lauded by philosophers from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Pete Seeger — is now being validated by medical research. It is used in targeted treatments for asthma, autism, depression and more, including brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and stroke.Live music has made its way into some surprising venues, including oncology waiting rooms to calm patients as they wait for radiation and chemotherapy. It also greets newborns in some neonatal intensive care units and comforts the dying in hospice.While musical therapies are rarely stand-alone treatments, they are increasingly used as adjuncts to other forms of medical treatment. They help people cope with their stress and mobilize their body's own capacity to heal."Patients in hospitals are always having things done to them," Mr. Rossetti explained. "With music therapy, we are giving them resources that they can use to self-regulate, to feel grounded and calmer. We are enabling them to actively participate in their own care."The Healing Power of Music"A Song for Wayne," performed by Edie Elkan and written as she played at the bedside of a student who was dying. Even in the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Rossetti has continued to perform live music for patients. He says that he's seen increases in acute anxiety since the onset of the pandemic, making musical interventions, if anything, even more impactful than they were before the crisis.Mount Sinai has also recently expanded its music therapy program to include work with the medical staff, many of whom are suffering from post-traumatic stress from months of dealing with Covid, with live performances offered during their lunch hour.It's not just a mood booster. A growing body of research suggests that music played in a therapeutic setting has measurable medical benefits."Those who undergo the therapy seem to need less anxiety medicine, and sometimes surprisingly get along without it," said Dr. Jerry T. Liu, assistant professor of radiation oncology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.A review of 400 research papers conducted by Daniel J. Levitin at McGill University in 2013 concluded that "listening to music was more effective than prescription drugs in reducing anxiety prior to surgery.""Music takes patients to a familiar home base within themselves. It relaxes them without side effects," said Dr. Manjeet Chadha, the director of radiation oncology at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York.It can also help people deal with longstanding phobias. Mr. Rossetti remembers one patient who had been pinned under concrete rubble at Ground Zero on 9/11. The woman, who years later was being treated for breast cancer, was terrified by the thermoplastic restraining device placed over her chest during radiation and which reawakened her feelings of being entrapped."Daily music therapy helped her to process the trauma and her huge fear of claustrophobia and successfully complete the treatment," Mr. Rossetti recalled.Some hospitals have introduced prerecorded programs that patients can listen to with headphones. At Mount Sinai Beth Israel, the music is generally performed live using a wide array of instruments including drums, pianos and flutes, with the performers being careful to maintain appropriate social distance."We modify what we play according to the patient's breath and heart rate," said Joanne Loewy, the founding director of the hospital's Louis Armstrong Center for Music & Medicine. "Our goal is to anchor the person, to keep their mind connected to the body as they go through these challenging treatments."Dr. Loewy has pioneered techniques that use several unusual instruments like a Gato Box, which simulates the rhythms of the mother's heartbeat, and an Ocean Disc, which mimics the whooshing sounds in the womb to help premature babies and their parents relax during their stay in noisy neonatal intensive care units.Dr. Dave Bosanquet, a vascular surgeon at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales, says that music has become much more common in operating rooms in England in recent years with the spread of bluetooth speakers. Prerecorded music not only helps surgical patients relax, he says, it also helps surgeons focus on their task. He recommends classical music, which "evokes mental vigilance" and lacks distracting lyrics, but cautions that it "should only be played during low or average stress procedures" and not during complex operations, which demand a sharper focus.Music has also been used successfully to support recovery after surgery. A study published in The Lancet in 2015 reported that music reduced postoperative pain and anxiety and lessened the need for anti-anxiety drugs. Curiously, they also found that music was effective even when patients were under general anesthesia.None of this surprises Edie Elkan, a 75-year-old harpist who argues there are few places in the health care system that would not benefit from the addition of music. The first time she played her instrument in a hospital was for her husband when he was on life support after undergoing emergency surgery."The hospital said that I couldn't go into the room with my harp, but I insisted," she said. As she played the harp for him, his vital signs, which had been dangerously low, returned to normal. "The hospital staff swung the door open and said, 'You need to play for everyone.'"Ms. Elkan took these instructions to heart. After she searched for two years for a hospital that would pay for the program, the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Hamilton, N.J., signed on, allowing her to set up a music school on their premises and play for patients at all stages in their hospitalization.Ms. Elkan and her students have played for over a hundred thousand patients in 11 hospitals that have hosted them since her organization, Bedside Harp, was started in 2002.In the months since the pandemic began, the harp players have been serenading patients at the entrance to the hospital, as well as holding special therapeutic sessions for the staff outdoors. They hope to resume playing indoors later this spring.For some patients being greeted at the hospital door by ethereal harp music can be a shocking experience.Recently, one woman in her mid-70s turned back questioningly to the driver when she stepped out of the van to a medley of familiar tunes like "Beauty and the Beast" and "Over the Rainbow" being played by a harpist, Susan Rosenstein. "That's her job," the driver responded, "to put a smile on your face."While Ms. Elkan says that it is hard to scientifically assess the impact — "How do you put a number on the value of someone smiling who has not smiled in six months?"— studies suggest that harp therapy helps calm stress and put both patients and hospital staff members at ease.Ms. Elkan is quick to point out that she is not doing music therapy, whose practitioners need to complete a five-year course of study during which they are trained in psychology and aspects of medicine."Music therapists have specific clinical objectives," she said. "We work intuitively — there's no goal but to calm, soothe and give people hope.""When we come onto a unit, we remind people to exhale," Ms. Elkan said. "Everyone is kind of holding their breath, especially in the E.R. and the I.C.U. When we come in, we dial down the stress level several decibels."Ms. Elkan's harp can do more than just soothe emotions, says Ted Taylor, who directs pastoral care at the hospital. It can offer spiritual comfort to people who are at a uniquely vulnerable moment in their lives."There is something mysterious that we can't quantify," Mr. Taylor, a Quaker, said. "I call it soul medicine. Her harp can touch that deep place that connects all of us as human beings."

When the coronavirus began to spread in the United States last spring, many experts warned of the danger posed by surfaces. Researchers reported that the virus could survive for days on plastic or stainless steel, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that if someone touched one of these contaminated surfaces — and then touched their eyes, nose or mouth — they could become infected.Americans responded in kind, wiping down groceries, quarantining mail and clearing drugstore shelves of Clorox wipes. Facebook closed two of its offices for a "deep cleaning." New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority began disinfecting subway cars every night.But the era of "hygiene theater" may have come to an unofficial end this week, when the C.D.C. updated its surface cleaning guidelines and noted that the risk of contracting the virus from touching a contaminated surface was less than 1 in 10,000."People can be affected with the virus that causes Covid-19 through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., said at a White House briefing on Monday. "However, evidence has demonstrated that the risk by this route of infection of transmission is actually low."The admission is long overdue, scientists say."Finally," said Linsey Marr, an expert on airborne viruses at Virginia Tech. "We've known this for a long time and yet people are still focusing so much on surface cleaning." She added, "There's really no evidence that anyone has ever gotten Covid-19 by touching a contaminated surface."During the early days of the pandemic, many experts believed that the virus spread primarily through large respiratory droplets. These droplets are too heavy to travel long distances through the air but can fall onto objects and surfaces.In this context, a focus on scrubbing down every surface seemed to make sense. "Surface cleaning is more familiar," Dr. Marr said. "We know how to do it. You can see people doing it, you see the clean surface. And so I think it makes people feel safer."But over the last year, it has become increasingly clear that the virus spreads primarily through the air — in both large and small droplets, which can remain aloft longer — and that scouring door handles and subway seats does little to keep people safe."The scientific basis for all this concern about surfaces is very slim — slim to none," said Emanuel Goldman, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, who wrote last summer that the risk of surface transmission had been overblown. "This is a virus you get by breathing. It's not a virus you get by touching."The Coronavirus Outbreak ›Latest UpdatesUpdatedApril 9, 2021, 3:29 p.m. ETPfizer and BioNTech requested the F.D.A.'s authorization to use their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds.Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination.Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations.The C.D.C. has previously acknowledged that surfaces are not the primary way that the virus spreads. But the agency's statements this week went further."The most important part of this update is that they're clearly communicating to the public the correct, low risk from surfaces, which is not a message that has been clearly communicated for the past year," said Joseph Allen, a building safety expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Catching the virus from surfaces remains theoretically possible, he noted. But it requires many things to go wrong: a lot of fresh, infectious viral particles to be deposited on a surface, and then for a relatively large quantity of them to be quickly transferred to someone's hand and then to their face. "Presence on a surface does not equal risk," Dr. Allen said.In most cases, cleaning with simple soap and water — in addition to hand-washing and mask-wearing — is enough to keep the odds of surface transmission low, the C.D.C.'s updated cleaning guidelines say. In most everyday scenarios and environments, people do not need to use chemical disinfectants, the agency notes."What this does very usefully, I think, is tell us what we don't need to do," said Donald Milton, an aerosol scientist at the University of Maryland. "Doing a lot of spraying and misting of chemicals isn't helpful."Still, the guidelines do suggest that if someone who has Covid-19 has been in a particular space within the last day, the area should be both cleaned and disinfected."Disinfection is only recommended in indoor settings — schools and homes — where there has been a suspected or confirmed case of Covid-19 within the last 24 hours," Dr. Walensky said during the White House briefing. "Also, in most cases, fogging, fumigation and wide-area or electrostatic spraying is not recommended as a primary method of disinfection and has several safety risks to consider."And the new cleaning guidelines do not apply to health care facilities, which may require more intensive cleaning and disinfection.Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, said that she was happy to see the new guidance, which "reflects our evolving data on transmission throughout the pandemic."But she noted that it remained important to continue doing some regular cleaning — and maintaining good hand-washing practices — to reduce the risk of contracting not just the coronavirus but any other pathogens that might be lingering on a particular surface.Dr. Allen said that the school and business officials he has spoken with this week expressed relief over the updated guidelines, which will allow them to pull back on some of their intensive cleaning regimens. "This frees up a lot of organizations to spend that money better," he said.Schools, businesses and other institutions that want to keep people safe should shift their attention from surfaces to air quality, he said, and invest in improved ventilation and filtration."This should be the end of deep cleaning," Dr. Allen said, noting that the misplaced focus on surfaces has had real costs. "It has led to closed playgrounds, it has led to taking nets off basketball courts, it has led to quarantining books in the library. It has led to entire missed school days for deep cleaning. It has led to not being able to share a pencil. So that's all that hygiene theater, and it's a direct result of not properly classifying surface transmission as low risk."Roni Caryn Rabin contributed reporting

Grizzly bears move across landscapes in much the same way as most people do, favoring flat paths over slopes and gentle speeds over sprints, according to a remarkable new study of grizzlies and how their outdoor lives compare to ours.The study, which involved wild and captive bears, a specialized treadmill, apple slices and GPS trackers, expands our understanding of how a natural drive to save energy shapes animals' behavior, including ours, and could have implications for health and weight management. The findings also help explain why, in the great outdoors, the paths of bears and people so often intersect, providing useful reminders about wilderness planning and everyone's safety.Biologists and other scientists have become increasingly interested in recent years in how we and other creatures make our way through our surroundings. And while some preliminary answers have begun to emerge about why we choose to move and navigate as we do, the findings are not, on the whole, especially flattering.Accumulating research suggests that we humans, as a species, are apt to be physically lazy, with a hard-wired inclination to avoid activity. In a telling 2018 neurological study, for example, brain scans indicated that volunteers were far more attracted by images of people in chairs and hammocks than of people in motion.This apparently inborn preference for not moving made sense for us once, long ago, when hunting and gathering demanded hard effort and plentiful calories and resting under a tree did not. Being inactive is more problematic now, with food everywhere.But the extent to which we share this penchant for physical ease with other species and whether these predilections affect how we and they traverse the world has remained unclear.So, cue grizzlies, particularly those living at the Washington State University Bear Center, the nation's primary grizzly bear conservation and research center. University biologists affiliated with the center study how the animals live, eat and interact with humans.Now, for the new study, which was published recently in the Journal of Experimental Biology, they decided to explore precisely how much energy grizzlies expend when they move in different ways and how those and comparable numbers might affect real-life behavior, not only of bears but of us and other animals.To start, they constructed a sturdy enclosure around a treadmill originally built for horses. With modifications, it could tip up or down by as much as 20 percent, while handling the size and weight of a grizzly. At the front of the enclosure, the scientists added a feeding box with a built-in rubber glove.Then they taught the center's nine male and female grizzlies — most of them resident at the center since birth and sporting names like John, Peeka and Frank — to clamber onto the treadmill and walk, while sedately accepting slices of hot dogs and apples as a reward."Grizzlies are very food driven," says Anthony Carnahan, a doctoral candidate at Washington State University who led the new study.VideoCreditBy measuring changes in the composition of the air in the enclosure, the researchers could track each bear's energy expenditure at varying speeds as they walked uphill and down. (The bears never ran on the treadmills, because of concerns for their safety.) Using this data, the researchers determined that the most efficient pace for the bears, physiologically — the one at which they used the least oxygen — was about 2.6 miles per hour.Finally, the scientists gathered available information about the movements of wild bears, using GPS statistics from grizzlies in Yellowstone National Park, along with mapping data and comparable numbers from past studies of people and other animals wandering through natural landscapes.Comparing the data, the scientists found that wild grizzlies, like us, seem born to laze. The researchers had expected the wild bears to move at their most efficient speed whenever possible, Mr. Carnahan says. But in reality, their average pace traveling through Yellowstone was a pokey and physiologically inefficient 1.4 miles per hour.They also almost invariably chose the least-steep route to get anywhere, even when it required extra time. "They did a lot of side-hilling," Mr. Carnahan says.Interestingly, these speeds and routes resembled those of people when picking routes through wildlands, the researchers noted.Taken as a whole, the findings suggest that the innate urge to avoid exertion plays a greater role in how all creatures, great and small, typically behave and navigate than we might imagine.The study does not rule out, however, that grizzlies, like other bears, can move with sudden, staggering speed and ferocity, when they decide to, Mr. Carnahan points out. "I've seen a bear run across a mountain meadow in six or seven minutes, when it took me all afternoon," he says.The results likewise do not tell us that we humans are fated always to hike slowly, sticking to the flats, but only that it may require mental as well as physical effort and goal setting to avoid defaulting to the easiest routes.Finally, the study is a bracing reminder that we share the outdoors with large apex predators who may naturally pick the same pathways as us.

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of awareness based on the idea of plurality. Instead of positing a singular principle, telos, or essence as noumenon, we model it as plurality accessible through multiple forms of awareness ("n-awareness"). In contrast to many other approaches, our model is committed to pluralist thinking. The noumenon is plural, and reality is neither reducible nor irreducible. Nothing dies out in meaning making. We begin by mathematizing the concept of awareness by appealing to the mathematical formalism of higher category theory. The beauty of higher category theory lies in its universality. Pluralism is categorical. In particular, we model awareness using the theories of derived categories and (infinity, 1)-topoi which will give rise to our meta-language. We then posit a "grammar" ("n-declension") which could express n-awareness, accompanied by a new temporal ontology ("n-time"). Our framework allows us to revisit old problems in the philosophy of time: how is change possible and what do we mean by simultaneity and coincidence? Another question which could be re-conceptualized in our model is one of soteriology related to this pluralism: what is a self in this context? A new model of "personal identity over time" is thus introduced.

There is tension between commonly held views concerning phenomenal imagery on the one hand and our first-person epistemic access to it on the other. This tension is evident in many individual issues and experiments in philosophy and psychology (e.g. inattentional and change blindness, the speckled hen, dream coloration, visual periphery). To dissolve it, we can give up either (i) that we lack full introspective access to the phenomenal properties of our imagistic experiences, or (ii) that phenomenal imagery is fully determined, or (iii) that phenomenal imagery does not exist. Which option is preferable? I explore the feasibility of option (ii) in more details by distinguishing between dierent kinds of indeterminacy. One of the most often proclaimed versions of indeterminacy is tied to Representationalism. However, I argue that in this context, Representationalism appears to be the least satisfying option, for which I give ten reasons. By abduction, we should reject Representationalism in favour of (i) or (iii)—the most parsimonious option being eliminativism, and the most conservative being the rejection of privileged access. The decision between these two, however, should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on which is most adequate given the data. I illustrate this with the comparison between visual agnosia and Charles-Bonnet-Syndrome.

A recently developed computational and neurobiological theory of phenomenal consciousness is applied to a series of persistent philosophical problems of consciousness (in recent formulations by Tye, Searle, and Chalmers). Each problem has a clear solution, as is briefly explained here.

According to the resemblance account of 'what it's like' and similar constructions, a sentence such as 'there is something it's like to have a toothache' means 'there is something having a toothache resembles'. This account has proved controversial in the literature; some writers endorse it, many reject it. We show that this conflict is illusory. Drawing on the semantics of intensional transitive verbs, we show that there are two versions of the resemblance account, depending on whether 'resembles' is construed notionally or relationally. While well-known criticisms of the resemblance account undermine its relational version, they do not touch its notional version. On the contrary, the notional version is equivalent to various accounts usually interpreted as rivals to resemblance. We end by noting that this resolution of the controversy (a) explains why 'like', which is a comparative, appears in a construction that concerns the properties of events, and (b) removes any pressure to suppose that 'like' is ambiguous between a comparative and a non-comparative sense.

Illusionists claim that phenomenal consciousness does not exist, but merely seems to exist. Most debates concerning illusionism focus on whether or not it is true – whether phenomenal consciousness really is an illusion. Here I want to tackle a different question: assuming illusionism is true, what kind of illusion is the illusion of phenomenality? Is it a "rich" illusion – the cognitively impenetrable activation of an incorrect representation – or a "sparse" illusion – the cognitively impenetrable activation of an incomplete representation, which leads to drawing incorrect judgments? I present this distinction and I classify the most influential illusionist theories along this line of divide. I then offer an argument against the accounts of the illusion of phenomenality in terms of sparse illusion.

Is the brain the biological substrate of consciousness? Most naturalistic philosophers of mind have supposed that the answer must obviously be «yes » to this question. However, a growing number of philosophers working in 4e (embodied, embedded, extended, enactive) cognitive science have begun to challenge this assumption, arguing instead that consciousness supervenes on the whole embodied animal in dynamic interaction with the environment. We call views that share this claim dynamic sensorimotor theories of consciousness (DSM). Clark (2009) a founder and leading proponent of the hypothesis of the extended mind, demurs, arguing that as matter of fact the biology of consciousness doesn't allow for a brain, body and world boundary crossing architecture. We begin by looking at one of the arguments for DSM, the variable neural correlates argument. We then outline two criticisms that Clark has made of this argument and endorse his criticisms. However we finish up by using the case of sensory substitution to argue that something of this argument for DSM nevertheless survives. We suggest that Clark ought to concede sensory substitution as a case in which the conscious mind extends.

The view that phenomenally conscious robots are on the horizon often rests on a certain philosophical view about consciousness, one we call "nomological behaviorism." The view entails that, as a matter of nomological necessity, if a robot had exactly the same patterns of dispositions to peripheral behavior as a phenomenally conscious being, then the robot would be phenomenally conscious; indeed it would have all and only the states of phenomenal consciousness that the phenomenally conscious being in question has. We experimentally investigate whether the folk think that certain (hypothetical) robots made of silicon and steel would have the same conscious states as certain familiar biological beings with the same patterns of dispositions to peripheral behavior as the robots. Our findings provide evidence that the folk largely reject the view that silicon-based robots would have the sensations that they, the folk, attribute to the biological beings in question.

Passive frame theory attempts to illuminate what consciousness is, in mechanistic and functional terms; it does not address the "implementation" level of analysis (how neurons instantiate conscious states), an enigma for various disciplines. However, in response to the commentaries, we discuss how our framework provides clues regarding this enigma. In the framework, consciousness is passive albeit essential. Without consciousness, there would not be adaptive skeletomotor action.

Discusses recent work on representationalism, including: the case for a representationalist theory of consciousness, which explains consciousness in terms of content; rivals such as neurobiological type-type identity theory (Papineau, McLaughlin) and naive realism (Allen, Campbell, Brewer); John Campbell and David Papineau's recent objections to representationalism; the problem of the "laws of appearance"; externalist vs internalist versions of representationalism; the relation between representationalism and the mind-body problem.

I present the new realist philosophy by Jocelyn Benoist, in particular, his solution to the problem of the explanatory gap in the philosophy of mind.

The studies we report indicate that it is possible to manipulate explicit ascriptions of consciousness by manipulating whether an agent's behavior is deterministically caused. In addition, we explore whether this impact of determinism on consciousness is direct, or mediated by notions linked to agency – notions like moral responsibility, free will, deliberate choice, and sensitivity to moral reasons. We provide evidence of mediation. This result extends work on attributions of consciousness and their connection to attributions of agency by Adam Arico, Brian Fiala, and Shaun Nichols (Arico et al. 2011, Fiala et al. 2014) and supports it against recent criticisms (e.g., Sytsma 2014).

This book is an essay on human ignorance. It addresses several biases of ignorance, ranging from the relationship we have with the sciences to the relationship we must have with conscience and, especially, with happiness. The main objective is to present some essays that serve as tools so that they can help readers to transpose points of view, overcoming old obstacles and expanding topics from various areas of life. Before thinking about the relationship we should have with knowledge and conscience, the work suggests thinking about the relationship we need to have with our own ignorance.

The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Consciousness provides the most comprehensive overview of current philosophical research on consciousness. Featuring contributions from some of the most prominent experts in the field, it explores the wide range of types of consciousness there may be, the many psychological phenomena with which consciousness interacts, and the various views concerning the ultimate relationship between consciousness and physical reality. It is an essential and authoritative resource for anyone working in philosophy of mind or interested in states of consciousness.

This paper aims to uncover where the disagreement between illusionism and anti-illusionism about phenomenal consciousness lies fundamentally. While illusionists claim that phenomenal consciousness does not exist, many philosophers of mind regard illusionism as ridiculous, stating that the existence of phenomenal consciousness cannot be reasonably doubted. The question is, why does such a radical disagreement occur? To address this question, I list various characterisations of the term "phenomenal consciousness": (1) the what-it-is-like locution, (2) inner ostension, (3) thought experiments such as philosophical zombies, inverted qualia and Mary's room, (4) scientific knowledge about secondary properties, (5) theoretical properties such as being ineffable and being intrinsic, and (6) appearance/reality collapse. Then I examine whether each characterization provides (i) a dubitable sense of phenomenal consciousness in which the existence of phenomenal consciousness can be reasonably doubted, (ii) an indubitable sense in which its existence cannot be reasonably doubted, or (iii) a gray sense in which it is controversial whether its existence can be reasonably doubted. By doing so, I show that there is no single sense of phenomenal consciousness in which illusionists and anti-illusionists disagree whether the existence of phenomenal consciousness can be reasonably doubted. I conclude that the disagreement between illusionists and anti-illusionists is fundamentally terminological: while illusionists adopt a dubitable sense of phenomenal consciousness, anti-illusionists adopt an indubitable sense of phenomenal consciousness. Because of the extreme vagueness and ambiguity of the term "phenomenal consciousness", illusionists and anti-illusionists fail to see that they talk about different senses of phenomenal consciousness.

Horwich gibt eine feine Analyse von Wittgenstein (W) und ist ein führender W-Stipendiat, aber meinerMeinung nach sind sie alle hinter einer vollen Wertschätzung zurück, wie ich in dieser Rezension und vielen anderen ausführlich erkläre. Wenn man W (und vorzugsweise auch Searle) nicht versteht, dann sehe ich nicht, wie man mehr als ein oberflächliches Verständnis von Philosophie und höherem Denken und damit von allem komplexen Verhalten (Psychologie, Soziologie, Anthropologie, Geschichte, Literatur, Gesellschaft) haben könnte. Kurz gesagt, W hat gezeigt, dass, wenn Sie gezeigt haben, wie ein Satz im Zusammenhang mit Interesse verwendet wird, es nichts mehr zu sagen gibt. Ich beginne mit ein paar bemerkenswerten Zitaten und gebe dann, was ich denke, sind die minimalen Überlegungen notwendig, um Wittgenstein zu verstehen, Philosophie und menschliches Verhalten. Zunächst könnte man feststellen, dass es verdächtig sein sollte, "Meta" vor jedes Wort zu stellen. W bemerkte z.B., dass Metamathematik Mathematik wie jede andere ist. Die Vorstellung, dass wir aus der Philosophie austreten können (d.h. die beschreibende Psychologie des Denkens höherer Ordnung), ist selbst eine tiefe Verwirrung. Eine weitere Irritation hier (und während des akademischen Schreibens in den letzten 4 Jahrzehnten) ist der ständige umgekehrte sprachliche Sexismus von "ihrem" und "ihr" und "sie" oder "er/sie" usw., wo "sie" und "ihre" und "sie" gut machen würden. Ebenso, wird die Verwendung des französischen Wortes "Repertoire", bei dem das englische "Repertoire" recht gut funktioniert. Der größte Mangel ist das (wenn auch sehr häufige) völlige Versäumnis, das zu verwenden, was ich als die enorm leistungsfähige und intuitive Zwei-System-Ansicht von HOT und Searles Framework betrachte, die ich oben skizziert habe. Dies ist besonders ergreifend im Kapitel über die Bedeutung p111 ff. (besonders in den Fußnoten 2-7), wo wir in sehr schlammigem Wasser ohne den Rahmen von automatisierten echten nur S1, propositional DispositionS, COS usw. schwimmen. Man kann auch einen besseren Blick auf das Innere und das Äußere bekommen, indem man z.B. Johnston oder Budd liest (siehe meine Rezensionen). Horwich macht jedoch viele einschneidende Kommentare. Besonders gefiel mir seine Zusammenfassung der Bedeutung von Wes antitheoretischer Haltung auf P65. Er muss "On Certainty" stärker in den Vordergrund stellen, das kürzlich von Daniele Moyal- Sharrock, Coliva und anderen mit viel Aufwand beworfen und in meinen jüngsten Artikeln zusammengefasst wurde. Horwich ist erstklassig und seine Arbeit lohnt sich. Man hofft, dass er (und alle) Searle und einige moderne Psychologie sowie Hutto, Read, Hutchinson, Stern, Moyal-Sharrock, Stroll, Hacker und Baker etc. studieren werden, um eine breite moderne Sicht des Verhaltens zu erreichen. Die meisten ihrer Papiere sind auf academia dot edu und philpapers dot org, aber für PMS Hacker siehe http slash slash info dot sjc dot ox dot ac dot uk slash scr slash hacker slash DownloadPapers dot html Er gibt eine der schönsten Zusammenfassungen, wo uns ein Verständnis von Wittgenstein hinterlässt, das ich je gesehen habe. "Es darf keinen Versuch geben, unsere sprachliche/konzeptionelle Tätigkeit (PI 126) zu erklären, wie in Freges Reduktion der Arithmetik auf logik; kein Versuch, ihr erkenntnistheoretische Grundlagen zu geben (PI 124), wie sie auf der Grundlage von Berichten über ein vormethodikes Wissen beruhen; kein Versuch, idealisierte Formen davon (PI 130) als in gewissem Sinne Logiken zu charakterisieren; kein Reformversuch (PI 124, 132) wie in Mackies Fehlertheorie oder Dummetts Intuitionismus; kein Versuch, sie zu straffen (PI 133) wie in Quines Existenzbericht; kein Versuch, es konsistenter zu machen (PI 132) wie in Tarskis Antwort auf die Lügner-Paradoxien; und kein Versuch, es vollständiger zu machen (PI 133) wie bei der Klärung von Fragen der persönlichen Identität für bizarre hypothetische 'Teleportation'-Szenarien." Abschließend möchte ich vorschlagen, dass W mit der Perspektive, die ich hier gefördert habe, im Zentrum der zeitgenössischen Philosophie und Psychologie steht und nicht obskur, schwierig oder irrelevant ist, sondern schillernd, tiefgründig und kristallklar ist und dass es ist, eines der größten intellektuellen Abenteuer zu verpassen, das möglichist.

唯物主义、还原主义、行为主义、功能主义、动态系统理论和计算主义是流行的观点,但维特根斯坦却认为它们不连贯。行为研究包括人类生活的所有内容,但行为在很大程度上是自动的和无意识的,甚至意识部分,大多用语言表达(维特根斯坦与头脑等同),不是一种自在的,所以拥有西尔称为理性逻辑结构(LSR)的框架,我称之为高阶思想的描述性心理学(DPHOT)。在总结了维特根斯坦和西尔提出的框架后,现代推理研究扩展了这个框架,我展示了Carruther观点中的不足之处,这些观点渗透到大多数关于行为的讨论,包括当代行为科学。我认为,他的书是两本书的混合体,一本是认知心理学的摘要,另一本是头脑中标准哲学混乱的总结,并添加了一些新的行话。我建议,后者应该被视为不连贯或卡通的生活观点,以维特根斯坦的话,我们可以实践成功的自我治疗,把心灵/身体问题作为一个语言/身体问题。 那些希望从现代两个系统的观点来看为人类行为建立一个全面的最新框架的人,可以查阅我的书《路德维希的哲学、心理学、Min d和语言的逻辑结构》维特根斯坦和约翰·西尔的《第二部》(2019年)。那些对我更多的作品感兴趣的人可能会看到《会说话的猴子——一个末日星球上的哲学、心理学、科学、宗教和政治——文章和评论2006-2019年第3次(2019年)和自杀乌托邦幻想21篇世纪4日 (2019)

Несколько летназад, я достиг точки, где я обычно могу сказать из названия книги, или, по крайней мере, из названия глав, какие философские ошибки будут сделаны и как часто. В случае номинально научных работ они могут быть в значительной степени ограничены определенными главами, которые воск философские или попытаться сделать общие выводы о значении или долгосрочнойперспективезначение работы. Нормально однако научные вопросы факта великодушно interlarded с философски тарабаризом о чего эти факты значат. Четкое различие, которое Витгенштейн описал около 80 лет назад между научными вопросами и их описаниями различными языковыми играми, редко принимаются во внимание, и поэтому человек поочередно поражается наукой и встревожен ее бессвязным анализом. Так и с этим объемом. Если создать ум, более или менее похожий на наш, нужно иметь логическую структуру рациональности и понимание двух систем мышления (теория двойного процесса). Если философия об этом, нужно понимать различие между научными вопросами факта и философский вопрос о том, как язык работает в контексте, о котором идет речь, и о том, как избежать ловушек редукционизма и саентизма, но Kurzweil, как и большинство студентов поведения, в значительной степени невежественны. Он очарован моделями, теориями и понятиями, и желание объяснить, в то время как Витгенштейн показал нам, что нам нужно только описать, и что теории, концепции и т.д., это просто способы использования языка (языковые игры), которые имеют значение только в той мере, в какой они имеют четкий тест (ясные truthmakers, или как Джон Сирл (самый известный критик AI) любит говорить, Я попытался обеспечить начало этого в моих последних трудах.

पुस्तक पर टिप्पणी करने से पहले, मैं Wittgenstein और Searle और तर्कसंगतता की तार्किक संरचना पर टिप्पणी की पेशकश करते हैं. निबंध यहाँ ज्यादातर पहले से ही पिछले दशक के दौरान प्रकाशित कर रहे हैं (हालांकि कुछ अद्यतन किया गया है), एक अप्रकाशित आइटम के साथ, और यहाँ कुछ भी नहीं जो अपने काम के साथ रखा है के लिए एक आश्चर्य के रूप में आ जाएगा. डब्ल्यू की तरह, वह अपने समय का सबसे अच्छा standup दार्शनिक के रूप में माना जाता है और अपने लिखित काम एक चट्टान और groundbreaking भर के रूप में ठोस है. हालांकि, बाद में डब्ल्यू को गंभीरता से लेने में उनकी विफलता कुछ गलतियों और भ्रमों की ओर ले जाती है। बस कुछ उदाहरण: p7 पर वह दो बार नोट है कि बुनियादी तथ्यों के बारे में हमारी निश्चितता हमारे दावों का समर्थन कारण के भारी वजन के कारण है, लेकिन डब्ल्यू निश्चित रूप से 'पर कुछ' में दिखाया है कि वहाँ की सच केवल स्वयंसिद्ध संरचना पर शक की कोई संभावना नहीं है हमारी प्रणाली 1 धारणा, यादें और विचारों, क्योंकि यह अपने आप में निर्णय के लिए आधार है और खुद को न्याय नहीं किया जा सकता है. p8 पर पहले वाक्य में वह हमें बताता है कि निश्चितता संशोधन योग्य है, लेकिन 'निश्चितता' है, जो हम Certainty2 कह सकते हैं इस तरह के अनुभव के माध्यम से हमारे स्वयंसिद्ध और nonrevisable निश्चितता (Certainty1) का विस्तार करने का परिणाम है और पूरी तरह से अलग है के रूप में यह है प्रस्तावात्मक (सही या गलत)। यह निश्चित रूप से "भाषा द्वारा हमारी बुद्धि के मोहित के खिलाफ लड़ाई" जो डब्ल्यू पर और फिर से प्रदर्शन की एक क्लासिक उदाहरण है. एक शब्द- दो (या कई) अलग-अलग उपयोग। अपने पिछले अध्याय "प्रस्ताव की एकता" (पहले अप्रकाशित) भी पढ़ने से बहुत लाभ होगा डब्ल्यू "पर निश्चितता" या डीएमएस ओसी पर दो किताबें (मेरी समीक्षा देखें) के रूप में वे सच केवल S1 का वर्णन वाक्य और सच है या गलत के बीच अंतर स्पष्ट कर S2 का वर्णन करने वाले प्रस्ताव. यह मुझे एस के लिए एक दूर बेहतर दृष्टिकोण के रूप में हमलों के प्रस्ताव के रूप में S1 धारणा ले रही है क्योंकि वे केवल टी या एफ बन के बाद एक S2 में उनके बारे में सोच शुरू होता है. हालांकि, उनका कहना है कि प्रस्ताव वास्तविक या संभावित सत्य और झूठ के बयान की अनुमति, अतीत और भविष्य और कल्पना की, और इस तरह पूर्व या protolinguistic समाज पर एक बड़ा अग्रिम प्रदान करते हैं, cogent है. के रूप में वह यह राज्यों "एक प्रस्ताव सब पर कुछ भी है कि संतुष्टि की स्थिति निर्धारित कर सकते हैं ... और संतुष्टि की एक शर्त ... यह है कि इस तरह के और इस तरह की स्थिति है। या, एक जोड़ने की जरूरत है, कि हो सकता है या हो सकता है या मामला होने की कल्पना की जा सकती है. कुल मिलाकर, पीएनसी काम के एस आधा सदी से जिसके परिणामस्वरूप Wittgenstein पर कई पर्याप्त अग्रिमों का एक अच्छा सारांश है, लेकिन मेरे विचार में, डब्ल्यू अभी भी असमान है एक बार तुम समझ कि वह क्या कह रहा है. आदर्श रूप में, वे एक साथ पढ़ा जाना चाहिए: स्पष्ट सुसंगत गद्य और सामान्यीकरण के लिए Searle, डब्ल्यू perspicacious उदाहरण और शानदार aphorisms के साथ सचित्र. अगर मैं बहुत छोटा था मैं एक किताब लिखना होगा कि वास्तव में कर रही है. आधुनिक दो systems दृश्यसे मानव व्यवहार के लिए एक व्यापक अप करने के लिए तारीख रूपरेखा इच्छुक लोगों को मेरी पुस्तक 'दर्शन, मनोविज्ञान, मिनडी और लुडविगमें भाषा की तार्किक संरचना से परामर्श कर सकते हैं Wittgenstein और जॉन Searle '2 एड (2019). मेरे लेखन के अधिक में रुचि रखने वालों को देख सकते हैं 'बात कर रहेबंदर- दर्शन, मनोविज्ञान, विज्ञान, धर्म और राजनीति पर एक बर्बाद ग्रह --लेख और समीक्षा 2006-2019 3 एड (2019) और आत्मघाती यूटोपियान भ्रम 21st मेंसदी 4वें एड (2019).

There is a debate between David Barnett and Rory Madden concerning the features that "our naïve conception of conscious subjects" has. While Barnett claims that our conception demands that conscious subjects be simple, Madden holds that our conception demands that conscious beings be topologically integrated. In this paper, I aim to bring some empirical results concerning the rubber-hand illusions and bilocation illusions to bear on this topic. While I do not reach a definitive resolution to the dispute between Barnett and Madden, I suggest that, provisionally, the empirical results favor Barnett's proposal.

I present and I implement what I take to be the best approach to solve the meta-problem: the evidential approach. The main tenet of this approach is to explain our problematic phenomenal intuitions by putting our representations of phenomenal states in perspective within the larger frame of the cognitive processes we use to conceive of evidence.

Neutral monism aims at solving the hard problem of consciousness by positing entities that are neither mental nor physical. Benovsky has recently argued for the slightly different account that, rather than being neutral, natural entities are both mental and physical by having different aspects, and then argued in favour of an anti-realist interpretation of those aspects. In this essay, operating under the assumption of dual-aspect monism, I argue to the contrary in favour of a realist interpretation of these aspects by showing that the anti-realist interpretation collapses into neutral monism and that the realist interpretation is an interesting alternative. I close with a discussion of the realist interpretation of the aspects and its relation with panpsychism.

According to Chalmers (2018), the meta-problem of consciousness is 'the problem of explaining why we think that there is a problem of consciousness'. In this paper I argue that the key to understanding both consciousness itself and addressing the meta-problem is to understand what acquaintance is and what its objects are. Unfortunately, I think there are still some serious mysteries lurking here, which I present briefly in this commentary. In particular, on the view of acquaintance I favour, it is unclear how our acquaintance with the contents of experience can serve as data for our theory of conscious experience. I end with some speculations concerning how to address this mystery.

In this essay, I defend a mind-body dualism, according to which human minds are immaterial substances that exercise non-redundant causal powers over bodies, against the notorious problem of psychophysical causation. I explicate and reply to three formulations of the problem: (i) the claim that, on dualism, psychophysical causation is inconsistent with physical causal closure, (ii) the claim that psychophysical causation on the dualist view is intolerably mysterious, and (iii) Jaegwon Kim's claim that dualism fails to account for causal pairings. Ultimately, I conclude that these objections fail and that dualist interactionism is no more problematic or mysterious than physical causation.

In the article Qualitative Attribution, Phenomenal Experience and Being, by Mark Pharoah, the following corrections have been made.

Después de medio siglo en el olvido, la naturaleza de la conciencia es ahora la más caliente en las ciencias del comportamiento y la filosofía.comienzo con el trabajo pionero de Ludwig Wittgenstein en la década de 1930 (los Libros Azul y Marrón) y desde los años 50 hasta la actualidad por su sucesor lógico John Searle, he creado la siguiente tabla como heurística para promover este estudio. Las filas muestran varios aspectos o formas de estudiar y las columnas muestran los procesos involuntarios y los comportamientos voluntarios que comprenden los dos sistemas (procesos duales) de la Estructura Lógica de Conciencia (LSC), que también pueden considerarse como el Lógico Estructura de Racionalidad (LSR-Searle), de comportamiento (LSB), de personalidad (LSP), de la realidad (LSOR), de la intencionalidad (LSI) -el término filosófico clásico, la Psicología Descriptiva de la Conciencia (DPC), la Psicología Descriptiva del Pensamiento (DPT) –o mejor, el Lenguaje de lo Descriptivo Psicología del Pensamiento (LDPT), términos introducidos aquí y en mis otros escritos muy recientes.

Antes de comentar detalladamente sobre Haciendo lo Mundo Social (MSW) primero voy a ofrecer algunos comentarios sobre la filosofía (psicología descriptiva) y su relación con la investigación psicológica contemporánea como ejemplificado en las obras de Searle (S) y Wittgenstein (W), ya que siento que esta es la mejor manera de lugar Searle o cualquier comentarista sobre el comportamiento, en la perspectiva adecuada. Será de gran ayuda para ver mis comentarios de PNC, TLP, PI, OC, TARW y otros libros de estos dos genios de la psicología descriptiva. S no hace ninguna referencia a la declaración de la mente presciente de W como mecanismo en TLP, y su destrucción de ella en su trabajo posterior. Desde W, S se ha convertido en el principal deconstructor de estas vistas mecánicas de la conducta, y el psicólogo descriptivo más importante (filósofo), pero no se da cuenta de cómo completamente W lo anticipó ni, en general, hacer otros (pero ver los muchos papeles y libros de Proudfoot y Copeland en W, Turing y AI). El trabajo de S es mucho más fácil de seguir que W, y aunque hay cierta jerga, es sobre todo espectacularmente claro si te acercas desde la dirección correcta. Vea mis reseñas de W S y otros libros para más detalles. En general, MSW es un buen Resumen de los muchos avances sustanciales sobre Wittgenstein resultantes del medio siglo de trabajo de S, pero en mi opinión, W todavía es inigualable para la psicología básica una vez que entiendes lo que está diciendo (ver mis comentarios). Idealmente, deben leerse juntos: Searle para la clara prosa coherente y generalizaciones sobre la operación de S2/S3, ilustrada con los ejemplos perspicaces de W de la operación de S1/S2, y sus brillantes aforismos. Si yo fuera mucho más joven escribiría un libro haciendo exactamente eso.

Borrowing the functional modeling approach common in systems and software engineering, an implementable model of the functions of human consciousness proposed to have the capacity for general problem solving ability transferable to any domain, or true self-aware intelligence, is presented. Being a functional model that is independent of implementation, this model is proposed to also be applicable to artificial consciousness, and to platforms that organize individuals into what is defined here as a first order collective consciousness, or at higher orders into what is defined here as Nth order collective consciousness. Part I of this two-part article includes: Summary; Introduction; Set of Postulates One; Set of Postulates Two; Overview of the Model; Model of Homeostasis; Model of the Functional Units; Model of the Body System; Model of the Other Basic Life Processes; Model of the Other Functional Systems; Model of Perceptions in the Perceptual Fields; Model of Body Processes as Paths in the Perceptual Field; & Model of Conscious Awareness

O objetivo do presente trabalho é contrapor duas teorias que buscam explicar quais processos neurais dão origem a experiência consciente. Em um primeiro momento apresentarei a teoria de Peter Carruthers, que afirma que o fluxo de consciência surge a partir da memória de trabalho. Posteriormente apresentarei a teoria de Matt e Bill Faw, na qual a consciência é equivalente a uma memória, surgindo, portanto, dos mecanismos formadores da memória episódica. Mesmo que ambas sejam teorias afirmem que a consciência surge a partir da memória, os mecanismos neurais da memória de trabalho e da memória episódica são bastante diferentes, o que acarreta em implicações muito distintas em ambas as teorias. Apresentarei também o relato de caso do paciente H.M., pois este serve para que possamos testar ambas as teorias e verificar qual delas consegue fornecer uma explicação plausível do caso. E, por fim, utilizando critérios como coerência teórica e embasamento empírico, argumentarei que a teoria de Peter Carruthers é a teoria que melhor explica os mecanismos geradores da experiência consciente.

Twenty five years ago, Sir John Carew Eccles together with Friedrich Beck proposed a quantum mechanical model of neurotransmitter release at synapses in the human cerebral cortex. The model endorsed causal influence of human consciousness upon the functioning of synapses in the brain through quantum tunneling of unidentified quasiparticles that trigger the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, thereby initiating the transmission of information from the presynaptic towards the postsynaptic neuron. Here, we provide a molecular upgrade of the Beck and Eccles model by identifying the quantum quasiparticles as Davydov solitons that twist the protein α-helices and trigger exocytosis of synaptic vesicles through helical zipping of the SNARE protein complex. We also calculate the observable probabilities for exocytosis based on the mass of this quasiparticle, along with the characteristics of the potential energy barrier through which tunneling is necessary. We further review the current experimental evidence in support of this novel bio-molecular model as presented.

In recent decades, with advances in the behavioral, cognitive, and neurosciences, the idea that patterns of human behavior may ultimately be due to factors beyond our conscious control has increasingly gained traction and renewed interest in the age-old problem of free will. To properly assess what, if anything, these empirical advances can tell us about free will and moral responsibility, we first need to get clear on the following questions: Is consciousness necessary for free will? If so, what role or function must it play? Are agents morally responsible for actions and behaviors that are carried out automatically or without conscious control or guidance? Are they morally responsible for actions, judgments, and attitudes that are the result of implicit biases or situational features of their surroundings of which they are unaware? What about the actions of somnambulists or cases of extreme sleepwalking where consciousness is largely absent? Clarifying the relationship between consciousness and free will is imperative if we want to evaluate the various arguments for and against free will. For example, do compatibilist reasons- responsive and deep self accounts require consciousness? If so, are they threatened by recent developments in the behavior, cognitive, and neurosciences? What about libertarian accounts of free will? What powers, if any, do they impart to consciousness and are they consistent with our best scientific theories about the world? In this survey piece, I will outline and assess several distinct views on the relationship between consciousness and free will.

Peace, Culture, and Violence examines deeper sources of violence by providing a critical reflection on the forms of violence that permeate everyday life and our inability to recognize these forms of violence. Exploring the elements of culture that legitimize and normalize violence, the essays collected in this volume invite us to recognize and critically approach the violent aspects of reality we live in and encourage us to envision peaceful alternatives. Including chapters written by important scholars in the fields of Peace Studies and Social and Political Philosophy, the volume represents an endeavour to seek peace in a world deeply marred by violence. Topics include: thug culture, language, hegemony, police violence, war on drugs, war, terrorism, gender, anti-Semitism, and other topics..

Illusionism about consciousness is the thesis that phenomenal consciousness does not exist, but merely seems to exist. Embracing illusionism presents the theoretical advantage that one does not need to explain how consciousness arises from purely physical brains anymore, but only to explain why consciousness seems to exist while it does not. As Keith Frankish puts it, illusionism replaces the "hard problem of consciousness" with the "illusion problem." However, a satisfying version of illusionism has to explain not only why the illusion of consciousness arises, but also why it arises with its particular strength: Notably, why we are so deeply reluctant to recognize the illusory nature of consciousness. Explaining our strong intuitive resistance to illusionism means solving what I call the "illusion meta-problem," which I think is a part of the illusion problem. In this paper, I argue that current versions of illusionism are unable to solve the illusion meta-problem. I focus on two of the most promising recent illusionist theories of consciousness, and I show why they fail to explain the peculiar reluctance we encounter whenever we try to accept that consciousness is an illusion.

The aim of this work is to defend substance dualism by defeating two of its paramount potential defeaters. I will argue that a substance dualist position, neo-Thomistic hylomorphism, provides a solution to the causal pairing problem and a good explanation of neural correlates of consciousness. After an introductory first chapter, I'll explicate dualism's dominant potential defeaters in the next three chapters. Chapter 2 will clarify what neural correlates of consciousness are and the objection to dualism based on neural correlates. The following two chapters will distinguish and elucidate dualism's principal problem regarding mental causation, which I'll argue is the causal pairing problem. The fifth chapter will introduce and explain neo-Thomistic hylomorphism. Chapter 6 will apply neo-Thomistic hylomorphism to the causal pairing problem, providing a solution that appeals to a fundamental tenet of neo-Thomistic hylomorphism. In Chapter 7 I'll apply the view and an Aristotelian powers ontology to construct a model of neural correlates of consciousness that's intended to explain such correlations. The final chapter will offer a conclusion and briefly discuss relevant future research.

This paper is aiming to investigate the physical substrate of conscious process. It will attempt to find out: How does conscious process establish relations between their external stimuli and internal stimuli in order to create reality? How does consciousness devoid of new sensory input result to its new quantum effects? And how does conscious process gain mass in brain? This paper will also try to locate the origins of consciousness at the level of neurons along with the quantum effects of conscious process.

The mental realm seems different to the physical realm; the mental is thought to be dependent on, yet distinct from the physical. But how, exactly, are the two realms supposed to be different, and what, exactly, creates the seemingly insurmountable juxtaposition between the mental and the physical? This review identifies and discusses five marks of the mental, features that set characteristically mental phenomena apart from the characteristically physical phenomena. These five marks (intentionality, consciousness, free will, teleology, and normativity) are not presented as a set of features that define mentality. Rather, each of them is something we seem to associate with phenomena we consider mental, and each of them seems to be in tension with the physical view of reality in its own particular way. It is thus suggested how there is no single mind-body problem, but a set of distinct but interconnected problems. Each of these separate problems is analyzed, and their differences, similarities and connections are identified. This provides a useful basis for future theoretical work on psychology and philosophy of mind, that until now has too often suffered from unclarities, inadequacies, and conflations.

Thomas Nagel'ın "Yarasa Olmak Nasıl bir Şeydir" makalesi ve "Hiçbir Yerden Bakış" adlı kitabı aşırı derecede alıntılanmış iki eserdir. Buradaki argümanlar sıklıkla bilincin öznel boyutunun nesnel-bilimsel bir açıklamasının tümüyle yapılabilmesinin mümkün olmadığını gösteren, veya fizikalizmin sıkıntılarını dile getiren, veya düpedüz fizikalizmin bir reddi olarak algılanmış veya kullanılmışlardır. Bu çalışmamda her üç algının da, değişen oranlarda, hatalı olduğunu savunuyorum. Tezimi savunabilmek için, söylediğim üç ana yorumun, her birini özetliyor ve bunların her birinin neden yanlış olduğunu gösteriyorum. Böylelikle Nagel'ın ana projesi olan nesnel fenomenoloji önerisini öne çıkararak tüm bu hataların bu projenin genelde pek incelenmemesi veya incelendiğinde yanlış algılanmasına dayandığını ortaya koyuyorum. Bunları ikna edici şekilde yapmak için gösterdiğim gerekçeler nihayetinde Nagel'ın nesnel fenomenoloji projesi aracılığıyla "bilincin öznel karakterini nesnel bir şekilde açıklamaya çalıştığı" şeklindeki ikinci tezimi destekleyecektir.

Synopsis This book is an essay, it is an essay of Individualogy. It is an essay for "Individualism". It is a rehearsal, because it rehearses, in the awareness that it is a rehearsal, open to other rehearsals. I have no interest in having a closed structure. I am interested in having an open structure for openings. It is an open rehearsal for more questions and more answers. If you have to answer why I write it, who I write it for, or what I write it for, the answer is: "Love is the most important thing that exists" Everything else is a continuation of this thesis, as an answer The more men the book helps to love, the more fulfilled I will feel. Although my self-realization does not depend on it, I have an enormous desire to see the world, humanity, all animals, in harmony, with love. But I cannot go against anyone's free will. But nobody can contradict anyone's free will, nobody's free principle, so I believe that a book that asserts itself with self-help content comes in handy. Because the most I can do, because the most that each one can do, is to help others, others, to help themselves. Because he has to choose. For he has the choice. Always the choice. Always the free principle of each one. Always the free principle of each "Individuality". And, from here, the philosophical science of "Individualogy" partially arises. So that the doctrine of "Individualism" can be formally affirmed.

Two popular theses central to recent theorizing about consciousness are the transitivity principle and the transparency of experience. According to the former, conscious mental states are mental states we are aware of in some way. According to the latter, there is some awareness-relation that we seemingly cannot bear to our experiences. I argue that, within certain reasonable constraints, there is no precisification of these theses that renders them compatible.

The article presents a perspective on the scientific explanation of the subjectivity of conscious experience. It proposes plausible answers for two empirically valid questions: the 'how' question concerning the developmental mechanisms of subjectivity, and the 'why' question concerning its function. Biological individuation, which is acquired in several different stages, serves as a provisional description of how subjective perspectives may have evolved. To the extent that an individuated informational space seems the most efficient way for a given organism to select biologically valuable information, subjectivity is deemed to constitute an adaptive response to informational overflow. One of the possible consequences of this view is that subjectivity might be (at least functionally) dissociated from consciousness, insofar as the former primarily facilitates selection, the latter action.

In 'Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness', Frankish argues for illusionism: the thesis that phenomenal consciousness does not exist, but merely seems to exist. Illusionism, he says, 'replaces the hard problem with the illusion problem -- the problem of explaining how the illusion of phenomenality arises and why it is so powerful'. The illusion of phenomenality is indeed quite powerful. In fact, it is much more powerful than any other illusion, in the sense that we face a very special and unique intuitive resistance when trying to accept that phenomenality is an illusion. This is bad news for illusionists, because this means that they cannot entirely model their explanation of the illusion of consciousness on the explanation of other illusions. Explaining this unique intuitive resistance to illusionism may therefore constitute the hardest aspect of the illusion problem. However, I think that this aspect of the problem is solvable. I will outline a possible solution, which is based on the hypothesis that our (illusory) introspective representations of phenomenal states characterize them as having unique epistemological properties and as playing a special epistemological role.

This paper draws upon the work of three different philosophers, from America (Thomas Nagel), France (Henri Bergson) and Britain (Alfred North Whitehead), to argue for (i) the reality of subjectivity, (ii) the nonphysical nature of subjective consciousness that is dependent upon but not determined by the physical nature of the body, and (iii) the potential unity of a new concept of nature-on-the-move, as distinct from the bifurcation of nature that views only the objective as real. It then presents arguments for new understandings of positivism, interpretivism and the critical stance, in a unified and more coherent frame, going beyond Habermas, Foucault and Bourdieu, to a more fundamental understanding of the philosophical context, situating IS within a more inclusive concept of nature.

Open peer commentary on the article "Consciousness as Self-Description in Differences" by Diana Gasparyan. Upshot: I argue that a philosophy of consciousness refocused on second-order cybernetics in the way proposed by Gasparyan could not replace the reductionist program because the question of reduction would arise again within the framework of such an approach.

In the framework of materialism, the major attention is to find general organizational laws stimulated by physical sciences, ignoring the uniqueness of Life. The main goal of materialism is to reduce consciousness to natural processes, which in turn can be translated into the language of math, physics and chemistry. Following this approach, scientists have made several attempts to deny the living organism of its veracity as an immortal soul, in favor of genes, molecules, atoms and so on. However, advancement in various fields of biology has repeatedly given rise to questions against such a denial and has supplied more and more evidence against the completely misleading ideological imposition that living entities are particular states of matter. In the recent past, however, the realization has arisen that cognitive nature of life at all levels has begun presenting significant challenges to the views of materialism in biology and has created a more receptive environment for the soul hypothesis. Therefore, instead of adjudicating different aprioristic claims, the development of an authentic theory of biology needs both proper scientific knowledge and the appropriate tools of philosophical analysis of life. In a recently published paper the first author of present essay made an attempt to highlight a few relevant developments supporting a sentient view of life in scientific research, which has caused a paradigm shift in our understanding of life and its origin [1]. The present essay highlights the uniqueness of biological systems that offers a considerable challenge to the mainstream materialism in biology and proposes the Vedāntic philosophical view as a viable alternative for development of a biological theory worthy of life.

This paper defends a novel view of 'what it is like'-sentences, according to which they attribute certain sorts of relations—I call them 'affective relations'—that hold between events and individuals. The paper argues in detail for the superiority of this proposal over other views that are prevalent in the literature. The paper further argues that the proposal makes better sense than the alternatives of the widespread use of Nagel's definition of conscious states and that it also shows the mistakes in two prominent suggestions about the definition when properly understood: first, that it is empty and uninformative, and second, that it leads directly to a substantial claim in the theory of consciousness, namely that an individual is in a conscious state only if the individual is aware of their being in that state.

This philosophical anthropology tries to explore the basic categories of man's being in the worlds using a special quantum meta-ontology that is introduced in the book. Quantum understanding of space and time, consciousness, or empirical/nonempirical reality elicits new questions relating to philosophical concerns such as subjectivity, free will, mind, perception, experience, dialectic, or agency. The authors have developed an inspiring theoretical framework transcending the boundaries of particular disciplines, e.g. quantum philosophy, metaphysics of consciousness, philosophy of mind, phenomenology of space and time, and ontological relativity.

This paper explores whether consciousness can exist without attention. This is a hot topic in philosophy of mind and cognitive science due to the popularity of theories that hold attention to be necessary for consciousness. The discovery of a form of consciousness that exists without the influence of attention would require a change in the way that many global workspace theorists, for example, understand the role and function of consciousness. Against this understanding, at least three forms of consciousness have been argued to exist without attention: perceptual gist, imagistic consciousness, and phenomenal consciousness. After first arguing that the evidence is inconclusive on the question of whether these forms of consciousness exist without attention, I here present a fourth form of consciousness that is likely to be more successful: conscious entrainment. I argue that conscious entrainment is a form of consciousness associated with skilled behavior in which attention is sometimes absent.

In a recent paper, Eric Schwitzgebel argues that if materialism about consciousness is true, then the United States is likely to have its own stream of phenomenal consciousness, distinct from the streams of conscious experience of the people who compose it. Indeed, most plausible forms of materialism have to grant that a certain degree of functional and behavioral complexity constitutes a sufficient condition for the ascription of phenomenal consciousness – and Schwitzgebel makes a case to show that the United States as a whole fulfills this condition. One way to avoid this counter-intuitive consequence of materialism about consciousness is to adopt what Schwitzgebel calls an "anti-nesting principle": a principle that states that there can be no nested forms of phenomenal consciousness and that therefore a conscious whole cannot have parts that are themselves conscious. However, Schwitzgebel then proceeds in his paper to draw up various objections, notably based on thought experiments, in order to dismiss these kinds of "anti-nesting" principles. My aim in this paper is to present a version of a sophisticated anti-nesting principle that avoids Schwitzgebel's objections. This principle is reasonable, intuitive, and as non-arbitrary as possible. Moreover, it can resist the objections mounted by Schwitzgebel against simple anti-nesting principles. This principle helps materialists avoid the implication that the United States has its own stream of consciousness, while granting consciousness to some entities which, in many cases, are intuitive instantiators of phenomenal consciousness. This principle therefore constitutes a way out for a materialist who wants to deny that the United States is conscious.

Recent work on consciousness has featured a number of debates on the existence and character of controversial types of phenomenal experience. Perhaps the best-known is the debate over the existence of a sui generis, irreducible cognitive phenomenology – a phenomenology proper to thought. Another concerns the existence of a sui generis phenomenology of agency. Such debates bring up a more general question: how many types of sui generis, irreducible, basic, primitive phenomenology do we have to posit to just be able to describe the stream of consciousness? This book offers a first general attempt to answer this question in contemporary philosophy. It develops a unified framework for systematically addressing this question and applies it to six controversial types of phenomenal experience, namely, those associated with thought and judgment, will and agency, pure apprehension, emotion, moral thought and experience, and the experience of freedom.

This book challenges common debates in philosophy of mind by questioning the framework of placement problems in contemporary metaphysics. The author argues that placement problems arise when exactly one fundamental ontology serves as the base for all entities, and will propose a pluralist alternative that takes the diversity of our conceptual resources and ontologies seriously. This general pluralist account is applied to issues in philosophy of mind to argue that contemporary debates about the mind-body problem are built on this problematic framework of placement problems. The starting point is the plurality of ontologies in scientific practice. Not only can we describe the world in terms of physical, biological, or psychological ontologies, but any serious engagement with scientific ontologies will identify more specific ontologies in each domain. For example, there is not one unified ontology for biology, but rather a diversity of scientific specializations with different ontological needs. Based on this account of scientific practice the author argues that there is no reason to assume that ontological unification must be possible everywhere. Without this ideal, the scope of ontological unification turns out to be an open empirical question and there is no need to present unification failures as philosophically puzzling "placement problems".

In this book, Carlos Montemayor and Harry Haladjian consider the relationship between consciousness and attention. The cognitive mechanism of attention has often been compared to consciousness, because attention and consciousness appear to share similar qualities. But, Montemayor and Haladjian point out, attention is defined functionally, whereas consciousness is generally defined in terms of its phenomenal character without a clear functional purpose. They offer new insights and proposals about how best to understand and study the relationship between consciousness and attention by examining their functional aspects. The book's ultimate conclusion is that consciousness and attention are largely dissociated. Undertaking a rigorous analysis of current empirical and theoretical work on attention and consciousness, Montemayor and Haladjian propose a spectrum of dissociation—a framework that identifies the levels of dissociation between consciousness and attention—ranging from identity to full dissociation. They argue that conscious attention, the focusing of attention on the contents of awareness, is constituted by overlapping but distinct processes of consciousness and attention. Conscious attention, they claim, evolved after the basic forms of attention, increasing access to the richest kinds of cognitive contents. Montemayor and Haladjian's goal is to help unify the study of consciousness and attention across the disciplines. A focused examination of conscious attention will, they believe, enable theoretical progress that will further our understanding of the human mind.

This paper compares the theses of physicalism and functionalism – particularly the computacionalist line – with the biological naturalism of John Searle regarding the possibility of free will. In such contrast, each line is decomposed into its statements so that they can be reviewed. It is argued that the searlean biological naturalism can explain more than the other two philosophies on how free action can have the source of its motivation in what is external to the mental state that makes it beperformed. Finally, even if the issue of free will still is open, I shall argue that free will does not find any room in the scenario that the lines of physicalism and functionalism present.

Rene Descartes (1596 – 1650) is considered the founder of modern philosophy. Profoundly influenced by the new physics and astronomy of Kepler and Galileo, Descartes was a scientist and mathematician whose most long-lasting contributions in science were the invention of Cartesian coordinates, the application of algebra to geometry, and the discovery of the law of refraction, what we now call Snell's law.His most important books on philosophy were The discourse on method(1637) and The meditations(1642). Descartes' writings display an exemplary degree of clarity and an aversion to pedantry. I explore Descartes' break with Aristotle, but also shine a light on the intellectual continuity Descartes had with Aristotle's thought. I also draw attention to some overlooked but interesting possibilities for an experimental test of a dualistic theory of mind.

Higher-order thought theories maintain that consciousness involves the having of higher-order thoughts about mental states. In response to these theories of consciousness, an attempt is often made to illustrate that nonhuman animals possess said consciousness, overlooking an alarming consequence: attributing higher-order thought to nonhuman animals might entail that they should be held morally accountable for their actions. I argue that moral responsibility requires more than higher-order thought: moral agency requires a specific higher-order thought which concerns a belief about the rightness or wrongness of affecting another's mental states. This "moral thought" about the rightness or wrongness is not yet demonstrated in even the most intelligent nonhuman animals, thus we should suspend our judgments about the "rightness" or "wrongness" of their actions while further questioning the recent insistence on developing an animal morality.

The phenomenal concept strategy is considered a powerful response to anti-physicalist arguments. This physicalist strategy aims to provide a satisfactory account of dualist intuitions without being committed to ontological dualist conclusions. In this paper I first argue that physicalist accounts of phenomenal concepts fail to explain their cognitive role. Second, I develop an encapsulation account of phenomenal concepts that best explains their particularities. Finally, I argue that the encapsulation account, which features self-representing experiences, implies non-physical referents. Therefore, the account of phenomenal concepts that has strong explanatory power does not explain away dualist intuitions—rather, it reinforces dualism.

In this paper we propose a mechanism in the brain for supporting consciousness. We leave open the question of the origin of consciousness itself, although an acausal origin is suggested since it should mesh with the proposed quasi-acausal network dynamics. In particular, we propose simply that fixed-point attractors, such as exemplified by the simple deterministic Hopfield network, correspond to conscious moments. In a sort of dual to Tononi's Integrated Information Theory, we suggest that the "main experience" corresponds to a dominant fixed point that incorporates sub-networks that span the brain and maximizes "relatedness." The dynamics around the dominant fixed point correspond in some parts of the system to associative memory dynamics, and to more binding constraint satisfaction dynamics in other areas. Since the memories that we are familiar with appear to have a conscious origin, it makes sense that a conscious moment itself corresponds in effect to what amounts to memory recollection. Furthermore, since Hopfield-like networks are generative, a conscious moment can in effect be seen as a living, partially predicted memory. Another primary motivation for this approach is that alternative states can be naturally sensed, or contrasted, at the fixed points.

The undead have been evoked in philosophical hypotheses regarding consciousness, but such discussions often come across as abstract academic exercises, inapplicable to personal experience. Movie zombies illuminate these somewhat opaque philosophical debates via storytelling devices – narrative, characterization, dialogue and so forth – which approach experience and consciousness in an instinctively accessible manner. This chapter focuses on a particular strand of the subgenre: transition narratives, in which human protagonists gradually turn into zombies. Transition stories typically centralize social relationships; affiliations and interactions with other beings that give her (human) life meaning. These narratives routinely posit that consciousness and sociosexuality are intertwined aspects of experience that distinguish human from zombie, foregrounding a core romantic coupling and charting its decline as the protagonist transforms into a flesh-eating monster. These notions are explored via an indicative case study: Pretty Dead (2013). The film brings two views on the self – intuitive and empirical – into direct conflict, questioning their compatibility. The protagonist's sociosexual decline is employed to illustrate that a) there is a troubling disjuncture between rationalist-theoretical conceptions of selfhood and selfhood as it is experienced in the real, social realm, and b) there is a natural bridge between personal, introspective self-knowledge and external social selfhood. By depicting a form of selfhood that defies rationalist logic (zom-being), transitional zombie films not only animate philosophical debates about consciousness, but also challenge their viewers to develop new conceptual (theoretical and imaginative) vocabularies via which to describe and engage with both selfhood and sociosexuality.

Not-I/Thou: The Other Subject of Art and Architecture is a series of essays delineating the gray areas and black zones in present-day cultural production. Part One is an implicit critique of neo-liberal capitalism and its assault on the humanities through the pseudo-scientific and pseudo-empirical biases of academic and professional disciplines, while Part Two returns to apparent lost causes in the historical development of modernity and post-modernity, particularly the recourse to artistic production as both a form of mnemonics and periodic (and renascent) avant-garde agitation. In-between these twin systems of taking the measure of things, Art and Architecture, as forms of speculative intellectual capital, emerge from the shadow-lands of half-conscious and half-unconscious forces to become gestures toward a type of knowledge that has no utilitarian or generic agency. Defying the tendencies of such discourses to fall prey to instrumental orders that effectively neuter the inherent radical agenda of both, Art and Architecture are represented in this series of essays as noetic apparatuses, operating at the edge of authorized systems of knowledge, quietly and secretly validating and valorizing the shadowy and recondite, collective and personal operations of intellect in service to no particular end.

Although vision is the de facto model system of consciousness research, studying olfactory consciousness has its own advantages, as this collection of articles emphatically demonstrates. One advantage of olfaction is its computational and phenomenological simplicity, which facilitates the identification of basic principles. Other researchers study olfactory consciousness not because of its simplicity, but because of its unique features. Together, olfaction's simplicity and its distinctiveness make it an ideal system for testing theories of consciousness. In this research topic, the results of recent research into olfactory consciousness are presented.

It is not necessarily the case that we ever have experiences of self, but human beings do regularly report instances for which self is experienced as absent. That is there are times when body parts, mental states, or actions are felt to be alien. Here I sketch an explanatory framework for explaining these alienation experiences, a framework that also attempts to explain the "mental glue" whereby self is bound to body, mind, or action. The framework is a multi-dimensional model that integrates personal and sub-personal components, psychological and neural processes. I then proceed to show how this model can be applied to explain the action-related passivity experiences of persons suffering from schizophrenia. I argue that a distinctive phenomenological mark of these experiences is that they are vividly felt, unlike ordinary actions (those taken to belong to self), and I seek to explain these heightened sensory experiences from within the proposed framework. I also propose hypotheses concerning such phenomena as thought insertion and anarchic hand syndrome that are motivated by this framework. Finally, I argue that the proposed model and view of self-experiences is consistent with several aspects of and theories of consciousness, especially theories which indicate that consciousness is more likely to be engaged when we are dealing with novelty or error—e.g. when self seems to have gone missing. I conclude by recommending that if we wish to learn about self, we would be well advised to attend closely to those times when it seems absent.

The complexity, subtlety, interlinking, and scale of many problems faced individually and collectively in today's rapidly changing world requires an epistemology--a way of thinking about our knowing--capable of facilitating new kinds of responses that avoid recapitulation of old ways of thinking and living. Epistemology, which implicitly provides the basis for engagement with the world via the fundamental act of distinction, must therefore be included as a central facet of any practical attempts at self/world transformation. We need to change how we think, not just what we think. The new epistemology needs to be of a higher order than the source of the problems we face. This theoretical, transdisciplinary dissertation argues that such a new epistemology needs to be recursive and process-oriented. This means that the thoughts about thinking that it produces must explicitly follow the patterns of thinking by which those thoughts are generated. The new epistemology is therefore also phenomenological, requiring the development of a reflexivity in thinking that recursively links across two levels of order--between content and process. The result is an epistemology that is of (and for) the whole human being. It is an enacted (will-imbued) and aesthetic (feeling-permeated) epistemology (thinking-penetrated) that is sensitive to and integrative of material, soul, and spiritual aspects of ourselves and our world. I call this kind of epistemology aesthetic, because its primary characteristic is found in the phenomenological, mutually fructifying and transformative marriage between the capacity for thinking and the capacity for feeling. Its foundations are brought forward through the confluence of multiple domains: cybernetic epistemology, the esoteric epistemology of anthroposophy (the spiritual science of Rudolf Steiner), and the philosophy of the implicit as developed by Eugene Gendlin. The practice of aesthetic epistemology opens new phenomenal domains of experience, shedding light on relations between ontology and epistemology, mind and body, logic and thinking, as well as on the formation (and transformation) of identity, the immanence of thinking in world-processes, the existence of different types of logic, and the nature of beings, of objects, and most importantly of thinking itself and its relationship to spirit.

The contribution of recent theories of sound and audition has been extremely significant for the development of a philosophy of auditory perception; however, none tackle the question of how our consciousness of auditory states arises. My goal is to show how consciousness about our auditory experience gets triggered. I examine a range of auditory mental phenomena to show how we are able to capture qualitative distinctions of auditory sensations. I argue that our consciousness of auditory states consists in having thoughts that organize our experience. Although my proposals could be adapted to fit with other theories of consciousness, here I expand David Rosenthal's high-order-thought theory and his quality-space theory, and show their usefulness for analyzing our auditory experience. I use quality-space to account for pitch, timbre, loudness, and sound location. I further show that our high-order-thoughts capture qualitative aspects of our auditory sensations. I conclude by demonstrating how a hypothetical listener in possession of a refined vocabulary describes and reports her high-order-thoughts about her musical experience.

If Australasian philosophers constitute the kind of group to which a collective identity or broadly shared self-image can plausibly be ascribed, the celebrated history of Australian materialism rightly lies close to its heart. Jack Smart's chapter in this volume, along with an outstanding series of briefer essays in A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand (Forrest 2010; Gold 2010; Koksvik 2010; Lycan 2010; Matthews 2010; Nagasawa 2010; Opie 2010; Stoljar 2010a), effectively describe the naturalistic realism of Australian philosophy of mind. In occasional semi-serious psychogeographic speculation, this long-standing and strongly-felt intellectual attitude has been traced back to the influences of our light, land, or lifestyle (Devitt 1996, x; compare comments by Chalmers and O'Brien in Mitchell, 2006). Australasian work in philosophy of mind and cognition has become more diverse in the last 40 years, but is almost all still marked, in one way or another, by the history of these debates on materialism.

This paper distinguishes two types of qualia theory, which I call Galilean and non-Galilean qualia theories. It also offers considerations against each type of theory. To my mind the considerations are powerful. In any case, they bring out the importance of distinguishing the two types of theory. For they show that different considerations come into play—or considerations come into play in quite different ways—in assessing the two types of theory.

Guest editor 's introduction to a special issue on the question of whether it is dangerous to drive while talking on the mobile phone and the philosophical questions that emerge from this debate.

Se comparan las teorías de Marr y Berkeley sobre la visión a partir de las cualidades de Descartes. La descripción de tres niveles de Marr, donde la conciencia está ausente, contrasta con el nivel único de Berkeley construido sobre la conciencia y la experiencia carece de importancia en los momentos esquemáticos y cobra protagonismo en el último paso del proceso de la visión de Marr mediante la noción de marcación. Bajo la premisa de que las descripciones puramente sincrónicas han de ser forzosamente incompletas, se reformula el problema de Molyneux y se reivindica el papel explicativo de la conciencia

I respond to Chalmers' (2006, 2010) objection to the Phenomenal Concept Strategy (PCS) by showing that his objection is faced with a dilemma that ultimately undercuts its force. Chalmers argues that no version of PCS can posit psychological features that are both physically explicable and capable of explaining our epistemic situation. In response, I show that what Chalmers calls 'our epistemic situation' admits either of a phenomenal or of a topic-neutral characterization, neither of which supports Chalmers' objection. On the one hand, if our epistemic situation is characterized phenomenally, then Chalmers' demand that PCS should explain our epistemic situation is misplaced. PCS can explain our epistemic situation only if there is a reductive explanation of consciousness. But according to PCS, no reductive explanation of consciousness can be given. On the other hand, if our epistemic situation is characterized topic-neutrally, then PCS is not only physically explicable, but it also explains our epistemic situation. Either way, PCS is safe

Bewusstsein ist nicht ohne Grund eines der grundlegenden Themen philosophischer Forschung: Es bildet den Kristallisationspunkt, in dem sich die intime Sphäre unserer Persönlichkeit im Schnittfeld mit radikal Anderem artikuliert. Dabei kommt dem subjektiven Bezug auf eine objektive Wirklichkeit, sprich auf uns selbst wie auf unsere natürliche und soziale Umgebung, eine zentrale Funktion zu. Aufgrund seiner Selbstverständlichkeit wird dieser Ausgriff auf die Wirklichkeit jedoch in repräsentationalistischen Ansätzen, die einen Großteil aktueller Bewusstseinstheorie ausmachen, häufig unhinterfragt vorausgesetzt. Dieses Buch entwickelt demgegenüber einen relationalen Erklärungsansatz, der diese Selbstverständlichkeit unserer Selbst- und Weltbezüge in den Mittelpunkt der Betrachtung stellt. In kritischer Auseinandersetzung mit Th. Metzingers Selbstmodelltheorie und im Rekurs auf J.G. Fichtes späte Wissenschaftslehre entsteht so die Konzeption eines projektiven Bewusstseins. Der damit einhergehende Fokus auf die Entstehung objektiver Wirklichkeit im Bewusstsein erlaubt es, den subjektiven Charakter unseres Bewusstseins besser verständlich zu machen.

Robert J. Howell offers a new account of the relationship between conscious experience and the physical world, based on a neo-Cartesian notion of the physical and careful consideration of three anti-materialist arguments. His theory of subjective physicalism reconciles the data of consciousness with the advantages of a monistic, physical ontology

Giulio Tononi (2008) has offered his integrated information theory of consciousness (IITC) as a "provisional manifesto." I critically examine how the approach fares. I point out some (relatively) internal concerns with the theory and then more broadly philosophical ones; finally I assess the prospects for IITC as a fundamental theory of consciousness. I argue that the IITC's scientific promise does carry over to a significant extent to broader philosophical theorizing about qualia and consciousness, though not as directly as Tononi suggests, since the account is much more focused on the qualitative character of experience rather than on consciousness itself. I propose understanding it as "integrated information theory of qualia" (IITQ), rather than of consciousness.

This book argues two main things: The first is that there is no such thing as free will—at least not in the sense most ordinary folk take to be central or fundamental; the second is that the strong and pervasive belief in free will can be accounted for through a careful analysis of our phenomenology and a proper theoretical understanding of consciousness.

This paper argues that the many and various conceptions of consciousness propounded by cognitive scientists and philosophers can all be understood as constituted with reference to four fundamental sorts of criterion: epistemic (concerned with kinds of consciousness), semantic (dealing with orders of consciousness), physiological (reflecting states of consciousness), and pragmatic (seeking to capture types of consciousness). The resulting four-fold taxonomy, intended to be exhaustive, suggests that all of the distinct varieties of consciousness currently encountered in cognitive neuroscience, the philosophy of mind, clinical psychology, and other related fields ultimately refer to a unified natural process, analysed under four general aspects. The proposed taxonomy will, it is hoped, possess sufficient clarity to serve as a sound theoretical framework for further scientific studies, and to count as a significant step in the direction of a properly formulated unified concept of consciousness.

Philosophical and scientific investigations of the proprietary aspects of self—mineness or mental ownership—often presuppose that searching for unique constituents is a productive strategy. But there seem not to be any unique constituents. Here, it is argued that the "self-specificity" paradigm, which emphasizes subjective perspective, fails. Previously, it was argued that mode of access also fails to explain mineness. Fortunately, these failures, when leavened by other findings (those that exhibit varieties and vagaries of mineness), intimate an approach better suited to searching for an explanation. Having an alternative in hand, one that shows promise of achieving explanatory adequacy, provides an additional reason to suspend the search for unique constituents. In short, a negative and a positive thesis are developed: we should cease looking for unique constituents and should seek to explain mineness in accord with the model developed here. This model rejects attempts to explain the phenomenon in terms of either a narrative or a minimal sense of self; it seeks to explain at a "molecular" level, one that appeals to multiple, interacting dimensions. The molecular-level model allows for the possibility that subjective perspective is distinct from a stark perspective (one that does not imply mineness). It proposes that the confounding of tacit expectations plays an important role in explaining mental ownership and its complement, disownership. But the confounding of tacit expectations is not sufficient. Because we are able to be aware of the existence of mental states that do not belong to self, we require a mechanism for determining degree of self-relatedness. One such mechanism is proposed here, and it is shown how this mechanism can be integrated into a general model of mental ownership. In the spirit of suggesting how this model might be able to help resolve outstanding problems, the question as to whether inserted thoughts belong to the patient who reports them is also considered.

We frame the question of what kind of subjective experience a brain simulation would have in contrast to a biological brain. We discuss the brain prosthesis thought experiment. Then, we identify finer questions relating to the original inquiry, and set out to answer them moving forward from both a general physicalist perspective, and pan-experientialism. We propose that the brain simulation is likely to have subjective experience, however, it may differ significantly from human experience. Additionally, we discuss the relevance of quantum properties, digital physics, theory of relativity, and information theory to the question.

Does thought have distinctive experiential features? Is there, in addition to sensory phenomenology, a kind of cognitive phenomenology--phenomenology of a cognitive or conceptual character? Leading philosophers of mind debate whether conscious thought has cognitive phenomenology and whether it is part of conscious perception and conscious emotion.

The evolution of nervous systems culminating in human consciousness might best be studied through an analysis of wakefulness and its constituent functions of sentience and cognition. The operative assumption in this model is that wakefulness emerged at the dawn of phylogeny and has been successively in-formed by an increasing complexity of sensory and cognitive functions. Wakefulness constitutes the essence of human consciousness but the cognitive and sentient functions complicate the analysis of the forms of awareness afforded to lower species. Folk psychology is recognized as a proper starting point for the analysis, as against a philosophical behaviorism that dispenses with the supposition of infrahuman sentience. The concepts of a dim awareness and instinctive automatisms, hitherto applied to non-human animals, are shown to confuse the dimness of primitive sensory and cognitive processing with a phylogenetically invariant wakefulness that, by hypothesis, cannot be attenuated in any species. Mundane behavioral evidence from infrahumans must remain the touchstone by which models of consciousness are to be assessed, not any program interpreting empirical evidence to the end of outlawing phenomenal experience in humans or infrahumans.

Hayek s philosophical psychology as set out in his The Sensory Order (1952) has, for the most part, been neglected. Despite being lauded by computer scientist grandee Frank Rosenblatt and by Nobel prize-winning biologist Gerald Edelman, cognitive scientists -- with a few exceptions -- have yet to discover Hayek s philosophical psychology. On the other hand, social theorists, Hayek s traditional disciplinary constituency, have only recently begun to take note and examine the importance of psychology in the complete Hayek corpus. This volume brings together for the first time state-of-the-art contributions from neuroscientists and philosophers of mind as well as economists and social theorists, all critically engaging in many aspects of Hayek's philosophical psychology.

John Searle offers what he thinks to be a reasonable scientific approach to the understanding of consciousness. I argue that Searle is demanding nothing less than a Kuhnian-type revolution with respect to how scientists should study consciousness given his rejection of the subject-object distinction and affirmation of mental causation. As part of my analysis, I reveal that Searle embraces a version of emergentism that is in tension, not only with his own account, but also with some of the theoretical tenets of science. I conclude that Searle has offered little to motivate scientists to adopt his proposal.

What is consciousness? How does the subjective character of consciousness fit into an objective world? How can there be a science of consciousness? In this sequel to his groundbreaking and controversial The Conscious Mind, David Chalmers develops a unified framework that addresses these questions and many others. Starting with a statement of the "hard problem" of consciousness, Chalmers builds a positive framework for the science of consciousness and a nonreductive vision of the metaphysics of consciousness. He replies to many critics of The Conscious Mind, and then develops a positive theory in new directions. The book includes original accounts of how we think and know about consciousness, of the unity of consciousness, and of how consciousness relates to the external world. Along the way, Chalmers develops many provocative ideas: the " consciousness meter", the Garden of Eden as a model of perceptual experience, and The Matrix as a guide to the deepest philosophical problems about consciousness and the external world. This book will be required reading for anyone interested in the problems of mind, brain, consciousness, and reality

This article is about the special, subjective concepts we apply to experience, called "phenomenal concepts". They are of special interest in a number of ways. First, they refer to phenomenal experiences, and the qualitative character of those experiences whose metaphysical status is hotly debated. Conscious experience strike many philosophers as philosophically problematic and difficult to accommodate within a physicalistic metaphysics. Second, PCs are widely thought to be special and unique among concepts. The sense that there is something special about PCs is very closely tied up with features of the epistemic access they afford to qualia. When we deploy phenomenal concepts introspectively to some phenomenally conscious experience as it occurs, we are said to be acquainted with our own conscious experiences. Accounts of PCs either have to explain the acquaintance relation, or acquaintance with our phenomenal experiences has to be denied. PCs have received much attention in recent philosophy of mind mainly because they figure in arguments for dualism and in physicalist responses to these arguments. The main topic of this article is to explore different accounts of phenomenal concepts and their role in recent debates over the metaphysical status of phenomenal consciousness.

This book presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness. The initial chapter distinguishes six main forms of consciousness and sketches an account of each one. Later chapters focus on phenomenal consciousness, consciousness of, and introspective consciousness. In discussing phenomenal consciousness, Hill develops the representational theory of mind in new directions, arguing that all awareness involves representations, even awareness of qualitative states like pain. He then uses this view to undercut dualistic accounts of qualitative states. Other topics include visual awareness, visual appearances, emotional qualia, and meta-cognitive processing. This important work will interest a wide readership of students and scholars in philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

Der erste Teil dieses Aufsatzes befasst sich mit der Tatsache, dass neben der Stammesgeschichte des Menschen (Phylogenese) und seiner je individuellen genetischen Ausstattung für seine Persönlichkeitsentwicklung besonders wichtig ist, dass sein Gehirn bei der Geburt noch unausgereift ist. In dieser Phase kommen Umwelteinflüsse (Lernen jeglicher Art) besonders stark zum Tragen, so daß die "Freiheit des Menschen" hier wesentlich begründet wird. Soviel uns das Studium der Frühentwicklung des Gehirns (Ontogenese) über seine Organisation und seine Funktionen hat verstehen lassen, bleibt doch fraglich, inwieweit die Hirnforschung uns in Fragen nach den seelisch-geistigen Fähigkeiten des Menschen, oder gar nach Gott und Gottesbildern weiterbringen kann. Im 2. Teil wird daher am Beispiel der Hirnfunktionen und der Frage nach dem Bewusstsein erläutert, warum menschliche Erkenntnisfähigkeit begrenzt ist. Die Naturwissenschaft behandelt Wenn-Dann-Fragen und liefert Gründe für das Dann. Sie kann jedoch weder Wesensfragen klären, noch den letzten Urgrund alles Seienden festmachen. Weil aber alles einen Grund haben muß, kann es ein absolutes Nichts niemals gegeben haben, oder geben. Daraus folgend wird im 3. Teil erläutert, dass es gerade rational Sinn macht, als Urgrund der Welt eine letzte Allmacht, also Gott zu denken. Religion kann demnach als höchste, weil freiheitlichste und damit menschlichste Leistung unseres Hirns verstanden werden. Die Evolution hat mit dem menschlichen Gehirn nicht nur die Stufe der Selbst-, sondern auch der Gottesreflexion erreicht. Dies könnte biologisch mit dem theologischen Begriff der Gottesebenbildlichkeit gemeint sein.

This book deals with the major philosophical issues in the theoretical framework of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in particular and cognitive science in general.

I went up to Oxford as an undergraduate to study physics. I chose Oxford over Cambridge at the urging of my school physics teacher who was an Oxford man. When I arrived, I found out that, as a physics student, I was expected to spend one day a week in the laboratory. This seemed to me extremely unappealing not only because it would interfere with my social life but also because the practical side of physics was, to my mind, deadly dull. Happily, I discovered that there was a new undergraduate degree—physics and philosophy—that combined theoretical physics with philo­ sophical issues in the foundations of physics as well as pure philosophy. For this degree no practi­ cal work was required.

Five years in the making and including over 250 concise entries written by leaders in the field, the volume covers both fundamental knowledge as well as more recent advances in this rapidly changing domain.

This volume of Ned Block's writings collects his papers on consciousness, functionalism, and representationism. A number of these papers treat the significance of the multiple realizability of mental states for the mind-body problem -- a theme that has concerned Block since the 1960s. One paper on this topic considers the upshot for the mind-body problem of the possibility of a robot that is functionally like us but physically different -- as is Commander Data of _Star Trek's_ second generation. The papers on consciousness treat such conceptual issues as phenomenal versus access consciousness, Dennett's theory of consciousness, and the function of consciousness, as well as such empirical matters as "How Not to Find the Neural Correlate of Consciousness," and an argument that there are distinct neural correlates for access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness. Turning to the mind-body problem, Block defends physicalism against Max Black's argument concerning phenomenal modes of presentation. The papers on representationism consider "mental paint" as well as the "Inverted Earth" thought experiment -- a world in which colors are reversed but there is a compensating reversal in the words that are used to describe them. _Consciousness, Function, and Representation_, bringing together papers that have appeared primarily in journals and conference proceedings, can be regarded as Block's most complete statement of his positions on consciousness

Contemporary philosophers of mind tend to assume that the world of nature can be reduced to basic physics. Yet there are features of the mind consciousness, intentionality, normativity that do not seem to be reducible to physics or neuroscience. This explanatory gap between mind and brain has thus been a major cause of concern in recent philosophy of mind. Reductionists hold that, despite all appearances, the mind can be reduced to the brain. Eliminativists hold that it cannot, and that this implies that there is something illegitimate about the mentalistic vocabulary. Dualists hold that the mental is irreducible, and that this implies either a substance or a property dualism. Mysterian non-reductive physicalists hold that the mind is uniquely irreducible, perhaps due to some limitation of our self-understanding. In this book, Steven Horst argues that this whole conversation is based on assumptions left over from an outdated philosophy of science. While reductionism was part of the philosophical orthodoxy fifty years ago, it has been decisively rejected by philosophers of science over the past thirty years, and for good reason. True reductions are in fact exceedingly rare in the sciences, and the conviction that they were there to be found was an artifact of armchair assumptions of 17th century Rationalists and 20th century Logical Empiricists. The explanatory gaps between mind and brain are far from unique. In fact, in the sciences it is gaps all the way down.And if reductions are rare in even the physical sciences, there is little reason to expect them in the case of psychology. Horst argues that this calls for a complete re-thinking of the contemporary problematic in philosophy of mind. Reductionism, dualism, eliminativism and non-reductive materialism are each severely compromised by post-reductionist philosophy of science, and philosophy of mind is in need of a new paradigm. Horst suggests that such a paradigm might be found in Cognitive Pluralism: the view that human cognitive architecture constrains us to understand the world through a plurality of partial, idealized, and pragmatically-constrained models, each employing a particular representational system optimized for its own problem domain. Such an architecture can explain the disunities of knowledge, and is plausible on evolutionary grounds

The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness is the first of its kind in the field, and its appearance marks a unique time in the history of intellectual inquiry on the topic. After decades during which consciousness was considered beyond the scope of legitimate scientific investigation, consciousness re-emerged as a popular focus of research towards the end of the last century, and it has remained so for nearly 20 years. There are now so many different lines of investigation on consciousness that the time has come when the field may finally benefit from a book that pulls them together and, by juxtaposing them, provides a comprehensive survey of this exciting field. An authoritative desk reference , which will also be suitable as an advanced textbook

Phenomenal consciousness is the property mental states, events, and processes have when, and only when, there is something it is like for their subject to undergo them, or be in them. What it is like to have a conscious experience is customarily referred to as the experience's phenomenal character. Theories of consciousness attempt to account for this phenomenal character. This article surveys the currently prominent theories, paying special attention to the various attempts to explain a state's phenomenal character in terms of its representational content.

This chapter surveys current approaches to consciousness in Anglo-American analytic philosophy. It focuses on five approaches, to which I will refer as mysterianism, dualism, representationalism, higher-order monitoring theory, and self-representationalism. With each approach, I will present in order the leading account of consciousness along its line, the case for the approach, and the case against the approach. I will not issue a final verdict on any approach, though by the end of the chapter it should be evident where my own sympathies lie

Ignorance and Imagination advances a novel way to resolve the central philosophical problem about the mind: how it is that consciousness or experience fits into a larger naturalistic picture of the world. The correct response to the problem, Stoljar argues, is not to posit a realm of experience distinct from the physical, nor to deny the reality of phenomenal experience, nor even to rethink our understanding of consciousness and the language we use to talk about it. Instead, we should view the problem itself as a consequence of our ignorance of the relevant physical facts, Stoljar shows that this change of orientation is well motivated historically, empirically, and philosophically, and that it has none of the side effects it is sometimes thought to have. The result is a philosophical perspective on the mind that has a number of far-reaching consequences: for consciousness studies, for our place in nature, and for the way we think about the relationship between philosophy and science.

Consciousness is extremely familiar yet it is at the limits—beyond the limits, some would say—of what one can sensibly talk about or explain. Perhaps this is the reason its study has drawn contributions from many fields including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, cultural and literary theory, artificial intelligence, physics, and others. The focus of this entry is on: the varieties of consciousness, different problems that have been raised about these varieties, and prospects for progress on these problems.

There are two broad classes of empirical theories of consciousness, which I will call the biological and the functional. The biological approach is based on empirical correlations between experience and the brain. For example, there is a great deal of evidence that the neural correlate of visual experience is activity in a set of occipetotemporal pathways, with special emphasis on the infero-temporal cortex. The functionalist approach is a successor of behaviorism, the view that mentality can be seen as tendencies to emit certain behavioral outputs given certain sensory inputs. The trouble with behaviorism is that it did not allow that mental states were causes and effects, but functionalists do allow this. They characterize consciousness in terms of its causal role: the causal influence on it from inputs and other mental states, and its causal efficacy with respect to other mental states and behavior. The central idea of functionalism is a proposal about the concept of consciousness, but scientific functionalists have filled the view in with empirical details—the idea is that a representation is conscious if it is broadcast in a global neuronal workspace. The functional approach says consciousness is a role, whereas the biological approach says consciousness is a realizer of that role. For example, one could take solubility to be a role—dissolving in certain circumstances—or, as with the biological view of consciousness, the physico-chemical configuration that has that role. The.

This is not just another book about consciousness: it takes the subject of consciousness forward, out of the impasse into which it has come

The problem of explaining consciousness remains a problem about the meaning of language: the ordinary language of consciousness in which we define and express our sensations, thoughts, dreams and memories. This book argues that the problem arises from a quest that has taken shape over the twentieth century, and that the analysis of history provides new resources for understanding and resolving it. Paul Livingston traces the development of the characteristic practices of analytic philosophy to problems about the relationship of experience to linguistic meaning, focusing on the theories of such philosophers as Carnap, Schlick, Neurath, Husserl, Ryle, Putnam, Fodor and Wittgenstein. Clearly written and avoiding technicalities, this book will be eagerly sought out by professionals and graduate students in philosophy and cognitive science.

Colin McGinn presents his latest work on consciousness in ten interlinked papers, four of them previously unpublished. He extends and deepens his controversial solution to the mind-body problem, defending the view that consciousness is both ontologically unproblematic and epistemologically impenetrable. He also investigates the basis of our knowledge that there is a mind-body problem, and the bearing of this on attempted solutions. McGinn goes on to discuss the status of first-person authority, the possibility of atomism with respect to consciousness, extreme dualism, and the role of non-existent objects in constituting intentionality. He argues that traditional claims about our knowledge of our own mind and of the external world can be inverted; that atomism about the conscious mind might turn out to be true; that dualism is more credible the more extreme it is; and that all intentionality involves non-existent objects. These are all surprising positions, but he contends that what the philosophy of mind needs now is 'methodological radicalism' - a willingness to consider new and seemingly extravagant ideas

William S. Robinson has for many years written insightfully about the mind-body problem. In Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness he focuses on sensory experience and perception qualities such as colours, sounds and odours to present a dualistic view of the mind, called Qualitative Event Realism, that goes against the dominant materialist views. This theory is relevant to the development of a science of consciousness which is now being pursued not only by philosophers but by researchers in psychology and the brain sciences. This provocative book will interest students and professionals who work in the philosophy of mind and will also have cross-disciplinary appeal in cognitive psychology and the brain sciences.

What place does consciousness have in the natural world? If we reject materialism, could there be a credible alternative? In one classic example, philosophers ask whether we can ever know what is it is like for bats to sense the world using sonar. It seems obvious to many that any amount of information about a bat's physical structure and information processing leaves us guessing about the central questions concerning the character of its experience. A Place for Consciousness begins with reflections on the existence of this gap. Is it just a psychological shortcoming in our merely human understanding of the physical world? Is it a trivial consequence of the simple fact that we just cannot be bats? Or does it mean there really are facts about consciousness over and above the physical facts? If so, what does consciousness do? Why does it exist? Rosenberg sorts out these problems, especially those centering on the causal role of consciousness. He introduces a new paradigm called Liberal Naturalism for thinking about what causation is, about the natural world, and about how to create a detailed model to go along with the new paradigm. Arguing that experience is part of the categorical foundations of causality, he shows that within this new paradigm there is a place for something essentially like consciousness in all its traditional mysterious respects. A striking feature of Liberal Naturalism is that its central tenets are motivated independently of the mind-body problem, by analyzing causation itself. Because of this approach, when consciousness shows up in the picture it is not introduced in an ad hoc way, and its most puzzling features can be explained from first principles. Ultimately, Rosenberg's final solution gives consciousness a causally important role without supposing either that it is physical or that it interacts with the physical

There are a number of different matters that come under the heading of 'consciousness'. One of them is phenomenality, the feeling of say a sensation of red or a pain, that is what it is like to have such a sensation or other experience. Another is reflection on phenomenality. Imagine two infants, both of which have pain, but only one of which has a thought about that pain. Both would have phenomenal states, but only the latter would have a state of reflexive consciousness. This entry will start with phenomenality, moving later to reflexivity and then to one other kind of consciousness.

Consciousness fits uneasily into our conception of the natural world. On the most common conception of nature, the natural world is the physical world. But on the most common conception of consciousness, it is not easy to see how it could be part of the physical world. So it seems that to find a place for consciousness within the natural order, we must either revise our conception of consciousness, or revise our conception of nature. In twentieth-century philosophy, this dilemma is posed most acutely in C. D. Broad's The Mind and its Place in Nature . The phenomena of mind, for Broad, are the phenomena of consciousness. The central problem is that of locating mind with respect to the physical world. Broad's exhaustive discussion of the problem culminates in a taxonomy of seventeen different views of the mental-physical relation.1 On Broad's taxonomy, a view might see the mental as nonexistent , as reducible, as emergent, or as a basic property of a substance . The physical might be seen in one of the same four ways. So a four-by-four matrix of views results. At the end, three views are left standing: those on which mentality is an emergent characteristic of either a physical substance or a neutral substance, where in the latter case, the physical might be either emergent or delusive

Dies ist kein wissenschaftlicher Text im engeren Sinne. Im Gegenteil: Das erste Ziel dieses Beitrags besteht zuerst darin, auf möglichst kurze und allgemeinverständliche Weise eine neue Problemlage zu skizzieren, die mit zunehmender Geschwindigkeit an Bedeutung gewinnt. Zweitens möchte ich einen vorläufigen Arbeitsbegriff anbieten, den Begriff einer "Bewusstseinskultur". Dieser neue Begriff soll dazu dienen, eine Reihe von ganz unterschiedlichen theoretischen und praktischen Strategien zusammenzufassen, die wir meiner Meinung nach benötigen werden, um der fraglichen Herausforderung gerecht zu werden. Der Begriff "Bewusstseinskultur" soll also zunächst nur eine Diskussionsgrundlage schaffen. Deshalb werde ich an dieser Stelle den schwierigen philosophischen Detailproblemen, die mit der Idee einer Bewusstseinskultur verbunden sind, auch nicht im Ansatz gerecht werden können. Ich hoffe aber, dass die Relevanz des Problems dieses etwas unanalytische und populäre Vorgehen am Ende auch in den Augen meiner eher kritischen Leser rechtfertigt.

My target in this paper is "theories of consciousness". There are many theories of consciousness around, and my view is that they are all misconceived. Consciousness is not a normal scientific subject, and needs handling with special care. It is foolhardy to jump straight in and start building a theory, as if consciousness were just like electricity or chemical valency. We will do much better to reflect explicitly on our methodology first. When we do this, we will see that theories of consciousness are trying to answer a question that isn't there

The paper introduces the field of consciousness studies to an audience outside of philosophy and the cognitive sciences, using the work of the late David Brooks as a starting point. Brooks' account of consciousness, and the cognitive and evolutionary significance of for-the-organism properties, are discussed. Brooks' account is evaluated in the light of the debate over conscious inessentialism; and alternative lines for developing Brooks' account are proposed, drawing on the work of Gerald Edelman.

Consciousness is perhaps the most puzzling problem we humans face in trying to understand ourselves. Here, eighteen essays offer new angles on the subject. The contributors, who include many of the leading figures in philosophy of mind, discuss such central topics as intentionality, phenomenal content, and the relevance of quantum mechanics to the study of consciousness

The relation between subjective consciousness and the physical brain is widely regarded as the last mystery facing science. David Papineau argues that there is no real puzzle here. Consciousness seems mysterious, not because of any hidden essence, but only because we think about it in a special way. Papineau exposes the confusion, and dispels the mystery: we see consciousness in its place in the material world, and we are on the way to a proper understanding of the mind.

Everyone — or almost everyone — was agreed that what is [mental] … has a common quality in which its essence is expressed: namely the quality of being conscious — unique, indescribable, but needing no description. All that is conscious … is [mental], and conversely all that is [mental] is conscious; that is self-evident and to contradict it is nonsense

In this wide-ranging study, Levine explores both sides of the mind-body dilemma, presenting the first book-length treatment of his highly influential ideas on the How does one explain the physical nature of an experience? This puzzle, the "explanatory gap" between mind and body, is the focus of this work by an influential scholar in the field.

In The Nature of Consciousness, Mark Rowlands develops an innovative account of the nature of phenomenal consciousness, one that has significant consequences for attempts to find a place for it in the natural order. The most significant feature of consciousness is its dual nature: consciousness can be both the directing of awareness and that upon which awareness is directed. Rowlands offers a clear and philosophically insightful discussion of the main positions in this fast-moving debate, and argues that the phenomenal aspects of conscious experience are aspects that exist only in the directing of experience towards non-phenomenal objects, a theory that undermines reductive attempts to explain consciousness in terms of what is not conscious. His book will be of interest to a wide range of readers in the philosophy of mind and language, psychology and cognitive science.

Though most contemporary philosophers and scientists accept a physicalist view of mind, the recent surge of interest in the problem of consciousness has put the mind /body problem back into play. The physicalists' lack of success in dispelling the air of residual mystery that surrounds the question of how consciousness might be physically explained has led to a proliferation of options. Some offer alternative formulations of physicalism, but others forgo physicalism in favour of views that are more dualistic or that bring in mentalistic features at the ground- floor level of reality as in pan-proto-psychism. My aim here is to give an overview of the recent philosophic discussion to serve as a map in locating issues and options. I will not offer a comprehensive survey of the debate or mark every important variant to be found in the recent literature. I will mark the principal features of the philosophic landscape that one might use as general orientation points in navigating the terrain. I will focus in particular on three central and interrelated ideas: those of emergence, reduction, and nonreductive physicalism. The third of these, which has emerged as more or less the majority view among current philosophers of mind, combines a pluralist view about the diversity of what needs to be explained by science with an underlying metaphysical commitment to the physical as the ultimate basis of all that is real. The view has been challenged from both left and right, on one side from dualists and on the other from hard core reductive materialists. Despite their differences, those critics agree in finding nonreductive physicalism an unacceptable and perhaps even incoherent position. They agree as well in treating reducibility as the essential criterion for physicality; they differ only about whether the criterion can be met. Reductive physicalists argue that it can, and dualists deny it

Physicalists commonly argue that conscious experiences are nothing more than states of the brain, and that conscious qualia are observer-independent, physical properties of the external world. Although this assumes the 'mantle of science,' it routinely ignores the findings of science, for example in sensory physiology, perception, psychophysics, neuropsychology and comparative psychology. Consequently, although physicalism aims to naturalise consciousness, it gives an unnatural account of it. It is possible, however, to develop a natural, nonreductive, reflexive model of how consciousness relates to the brain and the physical world. This paper introduces such a model and how it construes the nature of conscious experience. Within this model the physical world as perceived is viewed as part of conscious experience not apart from it. While in everyday life we treat this phenomenal world as if it is the "physical world", it is really just one biologically useful representation of what the world is like that may differ in many respects from the world described by physics. How the world as perceived relates to the world as described by physics can be investigated by normal science . This model of consciousness appears to be consistent with both third-person evidence of how the brain works and with first-person evidence of what it is like to have a given experience. According to the reflexive model, conscious experiences are really how they seem

The questions examined in the book speak directly to neuroscientists, computer scientists, psychologists, and philosophers

Brian O'Shaughnessy puts forward a bold and original theory of consciousness, one of the most fascinating but puzzling aspects of human existence. He analyses consciousness into purely psychological constituents, according pre-eminence to its epistemological power; the result is an integrated picture of the conscious mind in its natural physical setting. Consciousness and the World is a rich and exciting book, a major contribution to our understanding of the mind.

The aims of this book are: to explain the notion of phenomenal consciousness in a non-metaphorical way that minimizes controversial assumptions; to characterize the relationship between the phenomenal character and intentionality of visual experience, visual imagery and non-imagistic thought; and to clarify the way in which conscious experience is intrinsically valuable to us. It argues for the legitimacy of a first-person approach to these issues--one which relies on a distinctively first-person warrant for judgments about one's own experience. Thought experiments are employed in which one is asked to conceive of having various forms of blindsight, so as to make consciousness intellectually conspicuous by its absence in such hypothetical scenarios. It is argued that theories of mind that would commit us to denying either the conceptual or the metaphysical possibility of these scenarios neglect the occurrence of consciousness in this phenomenal sense

_Matters of Mind_ examines the mind-body problem. It offers a chapter by chapter analysis of debates surrounding the problem, including visual experience, consciousness and the problem of Zombies and Ghosts. It will prove invaluable for those interested in epistemology, philosophy of mind and cognitive science

A further development of Tye's theory of phenomenal consciousness along with replies to common objections

The mysteries of consciousness have gripped the human imagination for over 2,500 years. At the dawn of the new millennium, Understanding Consciousness provides new solutions to some of the deepest puzzles surrounding its nature and function. Drawing on recent scientific discoveries, Max Velmans challenges conventional reductionist thought, providing an understanding of how consciousness relates to the brain and physical world that is neither dualist, nor reductionist. Understanding Consciousness will be of great interest to psychologists, philosophers, neuroscientists and other professionals concerned with mind/body relationships, and all who care deeply about this subject.

Chapter 1: Two Concepts of Mind. I distinguish the phenomenal and psychological concepts of mind. I argue that every mental state is a phenomenal state, a psychological state, or a hybrid of the two. I discuss the two mind-body problems corresponding to the two concepts of mind, and discuss the various senses of the term "consciousness". Chapter 2: Supervenience and Explanation. I distinguish varieties of supervenience, especially logical and natural supervenience, where supervening properties covary with base properties across either logically possible or naturally possible worlds. Materialism is the thesis that all positive properties globally metaphysically supervene on microphysical properties. A property is reductively explainable in terms of physical properties if it globally logically supervenes on those properties.

This commentary is a plea to re-read after five years one, as it seems, almost forgotten book which has nevertheless clearly influenced the development of empirical approaches to consciousness. The book provides an illuminating look at the early period to the modern revival of consciousness research. Its subtitle 'Psychological and Philosophical Essays' describes the book's range precisely. Early attempts to disect the mystery of consciousness and many themes that are still preoccupying modern consciousness research are covered. While some areas of research have been progressed, theoretical views have not changed dramatically, and this book still seems a good guide to embark on a mysterious journey when exploring consciousness.

Love, fear, hope, calculus, and game shows-how do all these spring from a few delicate pounds of meat? Neurophysiologist Ian Glynn lays the foundation for answering this question in his expansive An Anatomy of Thought, but stops short of committing to one particular theory. The book is a pleasant challenge, presenting the reader with the latest research and thinking about neuroscience and how it relates to various models of consciousness. Combining the aim of a textbook with the style of a popularization, it provides all the lay reader needs to know to participate in the philosophical debate that is redefining our attitudes about our minds. Drawing on the rich history of neurological case studies, Glynn picks through the building blocks of our nervous system, examines our visual and linguistic systems, and probes deeply into our higher thought processes. The stories of great scientists, like Ramon y Cajal, and famous patients, like Sperry's split-brained epileptics, illuminate the scientific issues Glynn selects as essential for understanding consciousness. Some might argue that his lengthy explorations of natural selection overemphasize evolutionary explanations of psychological phenomena, but they must also agree that evolutionary psychology has distanced itself mightily from social Darwinism in recent years and merits a reappraisal. The great consciousness debate may form the core of the 21st-century Zeitgeist; get ready for it with An Anatomy of Thought. -Rob Lightner From Publishers Weekly How do we know? What do we think? How could a philosophical problem-'the mind-body problem,' say-induce a headache? What can evolutionary theory, molecular biology, the history of medicine and experimental psychology tell us about the features of human consciousness, and (once again) how do we know? Glynn, a physician and Cambridge University professor, meticulously attempts to answer these questions and more, setting forth the results of all sorts of research relevant to our brains-from 19th-century dissections to Oliver Sacks-like case studies, work with monkeys and supercomputers, and the enduring puzzles of philosophy, which he rightly saves for near the end. After explaining evolution by natural selection and 'clearing away much dross,' Glynn lays out the experiments and theories that have shown 'how nerve cells can carry information about the body, how they can interact' and how sense organs work; demonstrates the 'mixture of parallel and hierarchical organization' in our brains and 'the striking localization of function within it'; considers where neuroscience is likely to go; and admits that, among the many fields of exciting research just ahead, 'we can be least confident of progress toward a complete, scientific explanation of our sensations and thoughts and feelings.' Other recent explaining-the-brain books have sometimes advanced simplistic, or implausibly grand, claims about the nature and features of consciousness in general. Instead, Glynn offers a patient, informative, well-laid-out researcher's-eye view of what we have learned, how we figured it out and what we still don't know about neurons, senses, feelings, brains and minds. (Apr.) Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Library Journal The nature of consciousness, which perennially troubles the minds of scientists and philosophers, is the subject of an ever-growing body of literature. Two of the latest entries approach the topic from different perspectives. Glynn, a professor of physiology and head of the Physiological Laboratory at Cambridge, offers a comprehensive summary of what we know about the brain-both its evolution and its mechanisms. Among the topics he covers are natural selection, molecular evolution, nerves and the nervous system, sensory perception, and the specific structures responsible for our intellect. Using the mechanisms involved in vision and speech as models, Glynn skillfully describes various neurological deficiencies that can lead to 'disordered seeing' and problems with the use of language. He carefully distinguishes what we know through experimental evidence from what we know through the observation of patients with neurological damage. He also describes some of the major theories that attempt to explain why these structures arose. While his book concentrates on the structures that make up the mind, Glynn is well aware that some physical events appear explicable only in terms of conscious mental events-a situation that conflicts with the laws of modern physics. Only briefly, however, does he consider the various approaches that have been taken to deal with the issues of mind/body and free will. In contrast, this is the primary focus of The Physics of Consciousness. After reviewing the fundamentals of classic physics, Walker (who has a Ph.D. in physics) summarizes elements of the new physics in which our knowledge of space, time, matter, and energy are all dependent on the moment of observation. Walker explores the meaning of consciousness as a characteristic of the observer. In this context both the observer and the act of measurement are critical. In essence, Walker leads his reader on a journey through his concept of a 'quantum mind,' which can both affect matter (including other minds) and can be affected by other distant matter/minds. To break up what would otherwise be an extremely dense text, Walker also relates the very touching story of the loss of his high-school sweetheart to leukemia. Indeed, it is his memory of their relationship that drives Walker to seek an understanding of ultimate reality. At times, he has a tendency to be dogmatic-as when he concludes, 'our consciousness, our mind, and the will of God are the same mind.' While An Anatomy of Thought is appropriate for most academic libraries, the Physics of Consciousness will be most accessible to readers with some knowledge of advanced physics. -Laurie Bartolini, Illinois State Lib., Springfield Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Booklist The codiscoverers of natural selection-Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace-disagreed over the possibility of finding an evolutionary explanation for the human mind. Glynn here argues Darwin's side of the debate, tracing an eons-long path of development starting from simple amino acids floating in primal seas and extending through the erect hominids in which the powers of a massive brain first manifest themselves. Patiently adducing evidence of an evolutionary origin for the underlying molecular machinery, Glynn dissects the nerve centers that make possible speech and hearing, sight, and reading. Pressing deeper, he lays bare the cortical foundations of personality. But those who deal with the mind must attend also to the arguments advanced by philosophers. And it is when he turns from dendrites to syllogisms (especially the vexing mind-body paradox) that Glynn's empirical reasoning fails him. In the end, he concedes his perplexity in trying to conceive of an evolutionary origin for human consciousness. This concession may set the shade of Alfred Wallace to chortling, but it will draw readers into an honest confrontation with a profound enigma. Bryce Christensen

Theories of Consciousness provides an introduction to a variety of approaches to consciousness, questions the nature of consciousness, and contributes to current debates about whether a scientific understanding of consciousness is possible. While discussing key figures including Descartes, Fodor, Dennett and Chalmers, the book incorporates identity theories, representational theories, intentionality, externalism and new information-based theories

"Beats the heck out of me! I have some prejudices, but no idea of how to begin to look for a defensible answer. And neither does anyone else." That's the discussion of conscious experience offered by one of our most brilliant and readable psychologists, in his new 650-page book, modestly titled How the Mind Works. There is no widely accepted scientific program for researching consciousness. Speculation on the subject has been considered safe, careerwise, mainly for moonlighting physicists or physiologists whose Nobel Prizes and similar credentials are long since safely stored away. This essay describes some recent efforts of philosophers of mind who have stepped into the breach. Some argue that the puzzle of consciousness is impossible to solve, and some argue that with certain confusions removed there's no distinctive puzzle at all. I write from the standpoint of a third group who think the puzzle is difficult but tractable, and who get involved under the pretext that "philosophy is what you do to a problem until it's clear enough to do science to"

The basic question cognitivists and most analytic philosophers of mind ask is how consciousness arises in matter. This article outlines basic reasons for thinking the question spurious. It does so by examining 1) definitions of life, 2) unjustified and unjustifiable uses of diacritical markings to distinguish real cognition from metaphoric cognition, 3) evidence showing that corporeal consciousness is a biological imperative, 4) corporeal matters of fact deriving from the evolution of proprioception. Three implications of the examination are briefly noted: 1) the need to re-think the common assumption that unconsciousness historically preceded consciousness; 2) the need to delve as deeply and seriously into natural history as into brains and their computational analogues; 3) the need for a critical stance toward arm-chair judgments about consciousness and a correlative turn toward corporeal matters of fact

ABSTRACT: It is pointed out that the organisation of an organism necessarily involves fields which are the only means to make an approximately simultaneous tuning of the different subsystems of the organism-as-a-whole. Nature uses the olfactory fields, the acoustic fields, the electromagnetic fields and quantum-vacuum fields. Fields with their ability to comprehend the whole organism are the natural basis of a global interaction between organisms and of collective consciousness. Evidences are presented that electromagnetic potential fields mediate the collective field of consciousness. This result offers for the first time experimental access to the study of collective consciousness by measuring the field-related information-carrying potentials and their derivatives, the electric and magnetic fields between different individuals. The electrodynamic interaction of different brains/minds generates induction and in this way excitement, enhancement in the baseline of the interacting brains? activity. A list of empirical evidences is presented here proving the existence of this "interactive excitement" effect in the known phenomenon of collective consciousness. The fundamental phenomenon of the collective consciousness is known as " social facilitation " or "group effect ". The character and completion of consciousness are outlined in the frame of this picture, and the role of the "group effect " or " social facilitation " as a primary factor in developing consciousness is described. A quantum-physical model of a multi-layered consciousness is presented, where the layering is expressed by the subsequent subtlety of the masses of the material carriers of information. I show that as the mental levels get deeper and more sensitive the couplings are on more and more global scales of their environment. I point out that direct, immediate action in distance actually exists in the electromagnetic field, which is the coupling, mediator field between waves and particles. I show how the environmental, natural and cosmic fields are determinative sources of our consciousness. The results presented point out that the Collective Field of Consciousness is a significant physical factor of the biosphere. I show that the morphogenetic field has an electromagnetic nature. EM fields are vacuum fields. Different basic forms of vacuum fields exist, and all kinds of fields, including the particle-mediated fields as well, when overlapping each other, seem to be in a direct resonant coupling, and form a complex, merged biofield. The vacuum model of consciousness presented here points to the inductive generation of consciousness, and to its self-initiating nature. Individual and collective methods, as well as the experimental possibilities of a global healing and improving the consciousness field of mankind are suggested. Keywords: olfactory, acoustic, electromagnetic, vacuum fields, generation of consciousness, evolution of collective consciousness, social evolution, completion of consciousness, healing.

This dissertation argues for a "bundle thesis" of phenomenal consciousness: that the ways things seem to subjects are constituted by bundles of representational and functional properties. I argue that qualia are determined not only by intrinsic properties, but also by relational properties to other bodily and mental states . The view developed on the basis of this claim is called "phenomenal holism." ;Part I examines the current literature on phenomenal consciousness, sorting out various conceptual and historical issues. In particular, I show that current research falls into two camps: that claiming there is no coherent view of phenomenal consciousness or of how it can be studied, and that claiming that phenomenal consciousness is constituted by non-relational and non-causal/functional/representational properties. Neither camp believes that materialist theories of consciousness are possible. ;Part II counters the specific objections these writers raise against materialist theories. First I show that some of the most prominent objections are founded upon an implicit and misguided assumption: that qualia are non-relational simples, based on what I call the segregationist intuition. Then, more specifically, I argue: that while Kripke's argument from a posteriori necessity against the identity-theory is committed to the absence of an appearance/reality distinction, its presumptions entail this distinction; and that the symmetrical development of the possibility of "hidden qualia" shows that absent qualia and zombie arguments against functionalism are absurd. This last argument is extended to argue against the possibility of inverted spectra. It is concluded that none of the standard objections to materialist theories carry significant weight. ;Part III turns to relational theories of consciousness, and supports an "integrationist intuition" about the mind. I first show that higher-order perception and higher-order thought theories are inadequate, in spite of correctly construing consciousness relationally. I then go on to develop the bundle theory, drawing support from empirical research on vision and pain. The dissertation concludes by defending phenomenal holism and integrationist views of mind more generally, and setting directions for future research

Understanding consciousness is a truly multidisciplinary project, attracting intense interest from researchers and theorists from diverse backgrounds. Thus, we now have computational scientists, neuroscientists, and philosophers all engaged in the same effort. This book draws together the work of leading researchers around the world, providing insights from these three general perspectives. The work is highlighted by a rare look at work being conducted by Japanese researchers.

This paper surveys current theories on the nature of conscious experience, from traditional central state identity theories and functionalism, to more recent higher-order and representationalist theories. It is concluded that no current theory really solves the fundamental problem of how to incorporate conscious experience into the physical world, though much progress has been made

An evaluation of the strengths, weaknesses, and originality of Chalmer's book.

The book is an extended study of the problem of consciousness. After setting up the problem, I argue that reductive explanation of consciousness is impossible , and that if one takes consciousness seriously, one has to go beyond a strict materialist framework. In the second half of the book, I move toward a positive theory of consciousness with fundamental laws linking the physical and the experiential in a systematic way. Finally, I use the ideas and arguments developed earlier to defend a form of strong artificial intelligence and to analyze some problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection and phenomenal experience . This entry discusses the last two uses . Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it . Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experiences, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial

This book offers a comprehensive and broadly rationalist theory of the mind which continually tests itself against experimental results and clinical data. Taking issue with Empiricists who believe that all knowledge arises from experience and that perception is a non-cognitive state, Norton Nelkin argues that perception is cognitive, constructive and proposition-like. Further, as against Externalists who believe that our thoughts have meaning only insofar as they advert to the world outside our minds, he argues that meaning is determined 'in the head'. Finally, he offers an account of how we acquire some of our most basic concepts, including the concept of the self and that of other minds.

[opening paragraph]: Imagine you are a scientist from Mars observing Gary Kasparov playing a tournament with a chess computer. Would you have any reason to postulate consciousness in one player, but not the other? What is consciousness? How does the body produce it, and what is it for? Most people do not realize that there is a problem here because our conscious experience is the thing we know best. We are all familiar with the colours, smells and scenes around us, the pains and itches we feel and the thoughts that are in our heads. Our world consists of conscious experiences. By `conscious experience' I mean anything that you have an awareness of, absolutely anything. I do not mean anything recondite like your capacity to reflect upon your own experiences, something which one might suppose that only we as human beings have and animals do not. I mean the absolute basics, like feeling pain

This article is a version of the first half of an introduction to an anthology on consciousness. It is aimed at tracing the study of consciousness in psychology roughly since psychology pulled itself apart from philosophy as an independent discipline in the late nineteenth century. The second half, which will appear as a sequel to the present article, will cover the various philosophical problems involving consciousness, and trace the consciousness debate to date. The two articles are intended as a general introduction to the forthcoming special issue, Explaining Consciousness: the Hard Problem

This article is the second and final part of a general introduction to the concept, history, and problems of consciousness. The first was an overview of the study of consciousness in the history of psychology; this essay attempts to lay out the contemporary problems of consciousness and uncover their philosophical foundations. Together they serve as a prelude to the forthcoming special issue `Explaining Consciousness -- The Hard Problem'

The contributions to this book are original articles, representing a cross-section of current philosophical work on consciousness and thereby allowing students and readers from other disciplines to acquaint themselves with the very latest debate, so that they can then pursue their own research interests more effectively. The volume includes a bibliography on consciousness in philosophy, cognitive science and brain research, covering the last 25 years and consisting of over 1000 entries in 18 thematic sections, compiled by David Chalmers and Thomas Metzinger

Consciousness seems to be an enigmatic phenomenon: it is difficult to imagine how our perceptions of the world and our inner thoughts, sensations and feelings could be related to the immensely complicated biological organ we call the brain. This volume presents the thoughts of some of the leading philosophers and cognitive scientists who have recently participated in the discussion of the status of consciousness in science. The focus of inquiry is the question: "Is it possible to incorporate consciousness into science?" Philosophers have suggested different alternatives -- some think that consciousness should be altogether eliminated from science because it is not a real phenomenon, others that consciousness is a real, higher-level physical or neurobiological phenomenon, and still others that consciousness is fundamentally mysterious and beyond the reach of science. At the same time, however, several models or theories of the role of conscious processing in the brain have been developed in the more empirical cognitive sciences. It has been suggested that non-conscious processes must be sharply separated from conscious ones, and that the necessity of this distinction is manifested in the curious behavior of certain brain-damaged patients. This book demonstrates the dialogue between philosophical and empirical points of view. The writers present alternative solutions to the brain-consciousness problem and they discuss how the unification of biological and psychological sciences could thus become feasible. Covering a large ground, this book shows how the philosophical and empirical problems are closely interconnected. From this interdisciplinary exploration emerges the conviction that consciousness can and should be a natural part of our scientific world view

The most important scientific discovery of the present era will come when someone -- or some group -- discovers the answer to the following question: How exactly do neurobiological processes in the brain cause consciousness? This is the most important question facing us in the biological sciences, yet it is frequently evaded, and frequently misunderstood when not evaded. In order to clear the way for an understanding of this problem. I am going to begin to answer four questions: 1. What is consciousness? 2. What is the relation of consciousness to the brain? 3. What are some of the features that an empirical theory of consciousness should try to explain? 4. What are some common mistakes to avoid?

Garfinkel's techniques of ethnomethodological analysis permit a focus on 'moments of crisis' in dialogue. It is at such moments that the 'negotiation of meaning' is clearest. These ideas are applied to the analysis of Mambila 'spider' divination. Only binary questions may be posed. It is shown that in their interpretations to answers received, diviners redefine contradictions as calls to explore new possibilities. Contradictions in discourse serve to give us 'pause for thought' and constitute question rejecting moves. The article demonstrates how conversational analysis can be used as a powerful analytical tool of 'processual' anthropology.

The component structures of two distinct neuropsychological systems are described. "System-Y" depends upon "system-X" which, on the other hand, can operate independently of system-Y. System-X provides a matrix upon which system-Y must operate, and, system-Y is transformed by the operations of system-X. In addition these neuropsychological structures reverberate in political history and in the cosmos. The most fundamental structure in the soul, in society, and in the cosmos, has the form of a conical spiral. It can be described mathematically as an harmonic system and mythologically in terms of the birth, marriage and death of the divine-king. ;System-Y corresponds to the neocortex. System-X corresponds to the region below the cortex including the limbic brain. Many of the essential structures of system-Y are captured by Plato's image of the helmsman: orientation, locomotion, manual control and dexterity, visual guidance, verbal command, intention, and volition. System-X on the other hand has been systematically neglected by Western culture, beginning with Plato. ;The dissertation builds upon Yakovlev's distinction between "teleokinesis," "ectokinesis" and "endokinesis." "Teleokinesis" refers to goal-directed action in external space, and belongs to system-Y. Ectokinesis and endokinesis are components of system-X. "Endokinesis" refers to movements within the body. "Ectokinesis" refers to the emotions, which are expressions of endokinesis. The mechanics of ectokinesis is that of an harmonic or vibrational system, as is the mechanics of a musical instrument. ;Within a trance the structure of system-Y is temporarily altered, such that system-X enters the foreground of awareness. Because ectokinesis is analogous to music cultures inspired by trance experience understand the universe in terms of music. The structure of ectokinesis in a trance is that of a conical spiral. Plato inherited the mystical traditions of the ancient Near East but replaced the spiral of emotions with a spiral of ideas , by understanding the axis of the cone as the paradigmatic dimension, and the angular rotation of the spiral as the syntagmatic dimension, of language. Finally I explain how the mythology and political structure of theocratic society imitated the neuropsychological structures of trance experience

This article selectively surveys recent work touching consciousness. It discusses some recent arguments and positions with a view to throwing light on a working principle of much influential philosophical psychology, namely that the first?person point of view is theoretically redundant. The discussion is divided under a number of headings corresponding to specific functions that have been attributed to the first?person viewpoint, from the experience of something it is like to undergo physical processes, to the presence of selfhood, mental substance, meaning, understanding, and value. Arguments indicating limitations of the working principle are adduced, as well as arguments indicating possible exploitations of those limitations by first?personalist positions. Although some of the latter also have limitations, the direction in which the examination tends is that of a progressive widening of the concept of consciousness

In this book, William Lycan reviews the diverse philosophical views on consciousness--including those of Kripke, Block, Campbell, Sellars, and Casteneda--and ..

This book (in German) on "Physics, life and mind" is on the physical foundations of modern biology. The basic features of living systems, reproduction, mutation and metabolism, can be explained in terms of molecular processes involving nucleic acids as genetic material, and proteins as catalysts. The generation of structure and form in each generation results from spatiotemporal gene regulation in conjunction with the de novo formation of spatial order in which interplays of activation and inhibition play a crucial part. Brain functions can be understood in terms of information processing in neural networks. Fundamental limitations of explanations of biological phenomena on the basis of physics are expected for the relation between neural and mental states, which may not be fully decodable by finite procedures. A complete algorithmic theory of the human mind encompassing all, including self-referential, aspects appears to be impossible even in principle, not only in practice. The range and limitations of explanations of life on the basis of physical laws and processes reflect the scope and limits of science in general. In contrast to the notions in circulation in the 19th century, modern science is open at the metatheoretical level to different philosophical, cultural and religious interpretations of man and the universe. -/- .

This is a greatly expanded version of my article "Anarchism and the Beats," which was published in the book, The Philosophy of the Beats, by the University Press of Kentucky in 2012. It is both an historical and a philosophical analysis of the postwar American counterculture. It charts the historical origins of the postwar American counterculture from the anarchists and romantic poets of the early nineteenth century to a complex network of beat poets and pacifist anarchists in the early decades after World War II. The beat poets understood themselves to be religious prophets of a new form of liberated consciousness. Poetry was both a means to achieve this new form of consciousness and a means to express that consciousness once it was achieved by other means including travel, psychedelic drugs, sex or meditation. The transformation of consciousness sought by the beats was therefore primarily religious in nature, not political or ideological. However, that does not mean that the beats believed that the transformation of consciousness they sought had no political or social implications. On the contrary, the beats were almost all anarchists. It merely means that, for them, political ideology follows consciousness, not the reverse.

I detta dokument ger jag mina teorier, idéer och förklaringar till hur jag tror att medvetandet fungerar, vad det är och varför vi har det. Enligt mig är alla levande varelser bara biologiska maskiner, skulpterade av evolutionen för att bli så anpassad som möjligt till den miljö som de befinner sig i. Allt fungerar på ett speciellt sätt, det går att förklaras och förstås, det finns ingen magi, och medvetandet är inget undantag, det finns där av en anledning.

Consciousness. We have come to expect science to be able to explain all sorts of phenomena in the world (global warming, hereditary diseases, life – you name it). Consciousness is an anomaly in the success story of science for there is a real question whether science, in particular neuroscience, can explain much about what consciousness is. A good question to ask is how and to what extent consciousness resists scientific explanation. That might tell us something about what is special about consciousness.

The manuscript presents a summary of the results of the linguistic semantics study of Covid-19 related quarantine. Research conducted on a sample of Russian speaking Ukrainians. Found content and structure of the respective discursive field. Described features of inter-discourse connections. Established that the actualization of some discourses is accompanied by the deactivation of others, what makes quarantine semantics biased. Also, it was suggested that some of the discourses are indirectly positively associated and form the semantic core of the quarantine concept.

Objective. Study of the Covid-19 related quarantine concept as an emerging category of linguistic consciousness of Ukrainians. Materials & Methods. The strategy of the study is based on the logical and methodological concept of inductivism. Respondents were asked to write down their own understanding of the quarantine, formulate an appropriate definition and describe the situation, which in their opinion is the exact opposite to quarantine. Respondents also assessed how much their psychological well-being, their daily lifestyle during quarantine had changed, and ranked their preferences for the quarantine strategies proposed to them. A discursive analysis was applied to the obtained texts, as a result of which nine discourses were identified. These data, along with some socio-demographic characteristics were subjected to multidimensional mathematical and statistical processing. Results. Covid-19 related quarantine is represented in the linguistic consciousness of Russian-speaking Ukrainians by a discursive field, which includes at least nine recognizable, semantically autonomous discourses. Empirically discovered such phenomenon as – inter-discourse semantic dissociation. Its essence is a statistically significant reduction in the probability of some discourses appearing in the texts when others are being actualized there. This feature is associated with the innate negativity of the language and determines the semantic biasing of the quarantine concept. Inter-discourse semantic dissociation, as well as the influence of non-discursive factors constitute the discursive formation of the quarantine concept, which is qualitatively characterized by the hierarchical relationship of its components. At the same time, it was revealed that part of the discourses interacting "horizontally" are indirectly associated "vertically", which forms the stable semantic core of the quarantine concept. Partial empirical confirmation has been found of the previously put forward assumptions about: a) the existence of such a relationship between discourses and psychological defense mechanisms (as character-forming factors) that contributes to the hierarchical structure construction of discursive formations; b) the differential nature of discourses and mechanisms of psychological defenses interaction, which makes it possible to single out the discursive aspect in a characterological profile and consider a discourse as an operator of characterological semantics. Conclusions. An empirical study made it possible to form a primary idea of the substantive and structural semantic features of the quarantine concept, as an emerging category of linguistic consciousness of Ukrainians. The results obtained have a potentially useful application perspective. Thus, when implementing anti-epidemiological measures, it is important to consider the studied features of the discursive formation hierarchical structure of the quarantine concept, since discursive semantics are associated with cognitive focusing, which, in turn, affects the behavior direction and its upshots.

In this chapter we use methods of corpus linguistics to investigate the ways in which mathematicians describe their work as explanatory in their research papers. We analyse use of the words explain/explanation (and various related words and expressions) in a large corpus of texts containing research papers in mathematics and in physical sciences, comparing this with their use in corpora of general, day-to-day English. We find that although mathematicians do use this family of words, such use is considerably less prevalent in mathematics papers than in physics papers or in general English. Furthermore, we find that the proportion with which mathematicians use expressions related to 'explaining why' and 'explaining how' is significantly different to the equivalent proportion in physics and in general English. We discuss possible accounts for these differences.

Recursion: A Computational Investigation into the Representation and Processing of Language. By Lobina David

This article contains the results of a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon of natural language understanding (NLU), as a methodological problem. The combination of structural-ontological and informational-psychological approaches provided an opportunity to describe the subject matter field of NLU, as a composite function of the mind, which systemically combines the verbal and discursive structural layers. In particular, the idea of NLU is presented, on the one hand, as the relation between the discourse of a specific speech message and the meta-discourse of a language, in turn, activated by the need-motivational factors. On the other hand, it is conceptualized as a process with a specific structure of information metabolism, the study of which implies the necessity to differentiate the affective (emotional) and need-motivational influences on the NLU, as well as to take into account their interaction. At the same time, the hypothesis about the influence of needs on NLU under the scenario similar to the pattern of Yerkes-Dodson is argued. And the theoretical conclusion that emotions fulfill the function of the operator of the structural features of the information metabolism of NLU is substantiated. Thus, depending on the modality of emotions in the process of NLU, it was proposed to distinguish two scenarios for the implementation of information metabolism - reduction and synthetic. The argument in favor of the conclusion about the productive and constitutive role of emotions in the process of NLU is also given.

Psychologists have used experimental methods to study language for more than a century. However, only with the recent availability of large-scale linguistic databases has a more complete picture begun to emerge of how language is actually used, and what information is available as input to language acquisition. Analyses of such "big data" have resulted in reappraisals of key assumptions about the nature of language. As an example, we focus on corpus-based research that has shed new light on the arbitrariness of the sign: the longstanding assumption that the relationship between the sound of a word and its meaning is arbitrary. The results reveal a systematic relationship between the sound of a word and its meaning, which is stronger for early acquired words. Moreover, the analyses further uncover a systematic relationship between words and their lexical categories—nouns and verbs sound differently from each other—affecting how we learn new words and use them in sentences. Together, these results point to a division of labor between arbitrariness and systematicity in sound-meaning mappings. We conclude by arguing in favor of including "big data" analyses into the language scientist's methodological toolbox.

This book takes concepts developed by researchers in theoretical computer science and adapts and applies them to the study of natural language meaning. Summarizing over a decade of research, Chris Barker and Chung-chieh Shan put forward the Continuation Hypothesis: that the meaning of a natural language expression can depend on its own continuation.

In this paper we propose a way to deal with natural language inference by implementing Modern Type Theoretical Semantics in the proof assistant Coq. The paper is a first attempt to deal with NLI and natural language reasoning in general by using the proof assistant technology. Valid NLIs are treated as theorems and as such the adequacy of our account is tested by trying to prove them. We use Luo's Modern Type Theory with coercive subtyping as the formal language into which we translate natural language semantics, and we further implement these semantics in the Coq proof assistant. It is shown that the use of a MTT with an adequate subtyping mechanism can give us a number of promising results as regards NLI. Specifically, it is shown that a number of inference cases, i.e. quantifiers, adjectives, conjoined noun phrases and temporal reference among other things can be successfully dealt with. It is then shown, that even though Coq is an interactive and not an automated theorem prover, automation of all of the test examples is possible by introducing user-defined automated tactics. Lastly, the paper offers a number of innovative approaches to NL phenomena like adjectives, collective predication, comparatives and factive verbs among other things, contributing in this respect to the theoretical study of formal semantics using MTTs.

We introduce a set of biologically and computationally motivated design choices for modeling the learning of language, or of other types of sequential, hierarchically structured experience and behavior, and describe an implemented system that conforms to these choices and is capable of unsupervised learning from raw natural-language corpora. Given a stream of linguistic input, our model incrementally learns a grammar that captures its statistical patterns, which can then be used to parse or generate new data. The grammar constructed in this manner takes the form of a directed weighted graph, whose nodes are recursively (hierarchically) defined patterns over the elements of the input stream. We evaluated the model in seventeen experiments, grouped into five studies, which examined, respectively, (a) the generative ability of grammar learned from a corpus of natural language, (b) the characteristics of the learned representation, (c) sequence segmentation and chunking, (d) artificial grammar learning, and (e) certain types of structure dependence. The model's performance largely vindicates our design choices, suggesting that progress in modeling language acquisition can be made on a broad front—ranging from issues of generativity to the replication of human experimental findings—by bringing biological and computational considerations, as well as lessons from prior efforts, to bear on the modeling approach.

Utterances can convey more information than they explicitly encode, and speakers exploit communicative conventions in order to say more with less. However, the burden this places on perceivers is not well understood. This chapter examines the effect of speaker-specific information on pragmatic inferences using data from an experiment which investigated the time course of the use of pragmatic information in language comprehension. Previous evidence suggests that comprehenders who encounter a referential form, including a modifier that commonly indicates contrastiveness, assume that the referential form is being used contrastively. Thus, they consequently look to the relevant object in the scene very early when processing the referential expression. In this case, people appear to be implicitly following H. P. Grice's maxim of quantity. This chapter demonstrates that comprehenders stop using contrastive information early in resolving reference when speakers consistently do not use contrastive elements appropriately, consistent with a pragmatic explanation of referential contrast effects.

This paper investigates whether the model of local rhetorical coherence suggested in Knott et al. (2001) can boost the performance of the Centering-based metrics of entity coherence employed by Karamanis et al. (2004) for the task of information ordering. Rhetorical coherence is integrated into the way Centering's basic data structures are derived from the annotated features of the GNOME corpus. The results indicate that (a) the simplest metric continues to perform better than its competitors even when local rhetorical coherence is taken into account, and (b) this extra coherence constraint decreases its performance.

Probabilistic methods are providing new explanatory approaches to fundamental cognitive science questions of how humans structure, process and acquire language. This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception.

This has been made available gratis by the publisher. This piece gives the raison d'etre for the development of the converters mentioned in the title. Three reasons are given, one linguistic, one philosophical, and one practical. It is suggested that at least /two/ independent converters are needed. This piece ties together the extended paper "Abstracts from Logical Form I/II," and the short piece providing the comprehensive theory alluded to in the abstract of that extended paper in "Pragmatics, Montague, and 'Abstracts from Logical Form'" by motivating the entire project from beginning to end.

We combine state-of-the-art techniques from computational linguisticsand theorem proving to build an engine for playing text adventures,computer games with which the player interacts purely through naturallanguage. The system employs a parser for dependency grammar and ageneration system based on TAG, and has components for resolving andgenerating referring expressions. Most of these modules make heavy useof inferences offered by a modern theorem prover for descriptionlogic. Our game engine solves some problems inherent in classical textadventures, and is an interesting test case for the interactionbetween natural language processing and inference.

We present an implementation of a discourse parsing system for alexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar for discourse, specifying the integrationof sentence and discourse level processing. Our system is based on theassumption that the compositional aspects of semantics at thediscourse level parallel those at the sentence level. This coupling isachieved by factoring away inferential semantics and anaphoric features ofdiscourse connectives. Computationally, this parallelism is achievedbecause both the sentence and discourse grammar are LTAG-based and the sameparser works at both levels. The approach to an LTAG for discourse has beendeveloped by Webber and colleagues in some recent papers. Our system takes a discourseas input, parses the sentences individually, extracts the basic discourseconstituent units from the sentence derivations, and reparses the discoursewith reference to the discourse grammar while using the same parser usedat the sentence level.

In recent decades, the analysis of phraseology has made use of the exploration of large corpora as a source of quantitative information about language. This paper intends to present the main lines of work in progress based on this empirical approach to linguistic analysis. In particular, we focus our attention on some problems relating to the morpho-syntactic annotation of corpora. The CORIS/CODIS corpus of contemporary written Italian, developed at CILTA – University of Bologna (Rossini Favretti 2000; Rossini Favretti, Tamburini, De Santis in press), is a synchronic 100-million-word corpus and is being lemmatised and annotated with part-of-speech (POS) tags, in order to increase the quantity of information and improve data retrieval procedures (Tamburini 2000). The aim of POS tagging is to assign each lexical unit to the appropriate word class. Usually the set of tags is pre-established by the linguist, who uses his/her competence to identify the different word classes. The very first experiments we made revealed how the traditional part-of-speech distinctions in Italian (generally based on morphological and semantic criteria) are often inadequate to represent the syntactic features of words in context. It is worth noting that the uncertainties in categorisation contained in Italian grammars and dictionaries reflect a growing difficulty as they move from fundamental linguistic classes, such as nouns and verbs, to more complex classes, such as adverbs, pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions. This latter class, that groups together elements traditionally used to express connections between sentences, appears inadequate when describing cohesive relations in Italian. This phenomenon actually seems to involve other elements traditionally assigned to different classes, such as adverbs, pronouns and interjections. Recent studies proposed the class of 'connectives', grouping all words that, apart from their traditional word class, have the function of connecting phrases and contributing to textual cohesion. From this point of view, conjunctions can be considered as part of phrasal connectives, that can in turn be included in the wider category of textual connectives. The aim of this study is to identify elements that can be included in the class of phrasal connectives, using quantitative methods. According to Shannon and Weaver's (1949) observation that words are linked by dependent probabilities, corroborated by Halliday's (1991) argument that the grammatical "system" (in Firth's sense of the term) is essentially probabilistic, quantitative data are introduced in order to provide evidence of relative frequencies. Section 2 presents a description of word-class categorisation from the point of view of grammars and dictionaries arguing that the traditional category of conjunctions is inadequate for capturing the notion of phrasal connective. Section 3 examines the notion of 'connective' and suggests a truth-function interpretation of connective behaviour. Section 4 describes the quantitative methods proposed for analysing the distributional properties of lexical units, and section 5 comments on the results obtained by applying such methods drawing some provisional conclusions.

The processing of sequences of (English) sentences is analyzedcompositionally through transitions that merge sentences, rather thandecomposing them. Transitions that are in a precise senseinertial are related to disjunctive and non-deterministic approaches toambiguity. Modal interpretations are investigated, inducing variousequivalences on sequences.

There is currently much interest in bringing together the tradition of categorial grammar, and especially the Lambek calculus, with the recent paradigm of linear logic to which it has strong ties. One active research area is designing non-commutative versions of linear logic (Abrusci, 1995; Retoré, 1993) which can be sensitive to word order while retaining the hypothetical reasoning capabilities of standard (commutative) linear logic (Dalrymple et al., 1995). Some connections between the Lambek calculus and computations in groups have long been known (van Benthem, 1986) but no serious attempt has been made to base a theory of linguistic processing solely on group structure. This paper presents such a model, and demonstrates the connection between linguistic processing and the classical algebraic notions of non-commutative free group, conjugacy, and group presentations. A grammar in this model, or G-grammar is a collection of lexical expressions which are products of logical forms, phonological forms, and inverses of those. Phrasal descriptions are obtained by forming products of lexical expressions and by cancelling contiguous elements which are inverses of each other. A G-grammar provides a symmetrical specification of the relation between a logical form and a phonological string that is neutral between parsing and generation modes. We show how the G-grammar can be oriented for each of the modes by reformulating the lexical expressions as rewriting rules adapted to parsing or generation, which then have strong decidability properties (inherent reversibility). We give examples showing the value of conjugacy for handling long-distance movement and quantifier scoping both in parsing and generation. The paper argues that by moving from the free monoid over a vocabulary V (standard in formal language theory) to the free group over V, deep affinities between linguistic phenomena and classical algebra come to the surface, and that the consequences of tapping the mathematical connections thus established can be considerable.

This paper describes a computational model for analyzing arguments in discourse. In particular, the model describes processes necessary for interpreting one uninterrupted argument from a speaker. The resulting output is a representation for the underlying claim and evidence relations between propositions of the argument. For our processing model we present: (i) a characterization of coherent orderings of propositions, used to limit search for interpretation of each new proposition (ii) a working definition of the evidence relation, used to recognize connections between propositions (iii) a theory of the function and use of clue words — special words and phrases indicating the structure of the argument — then used in the analysis to control search for interpretation and verification of evidence relations.

Narrative passages told from a character's perspective convey the character's thoughts and perceptions. We present a discourse process that recognizes characters'.

The main result in this paper is a method for obtaining derivation trees from sentences of certain formal grammars. No parsing algorithm was previously known to exist for these grammars.Applied to Montague's PTQ the method produces all parses that could correspond to different meanings. The technique directly addresses scope and reference and provides a framework for examining these phenomena. The solution for PTQ is implemented in an efficient and useful computer program.

We introduce LTAG-spinal, a novel variant of traditional Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) with desirable linguistic, computational and statistical properties. Unlike in traditional LTAG, subcategorization frames and the argument-adjunct distinction are left underspeciﬁed in LTAG-spinal. LTAG-spinal with adjunction constraints is weakly equivalent to LTAG. The LTAG-spinal formalism is used to extract an LTAG-spinal Treebank from the Penn Treebank with Propbank annotation. Based on Propbank annotation, predicate coordination and LTAG adjunction structures are successfully extracted. The LTAG-spinal Treebank makes explicit semantic relations that are implicit or absent from the original PTB. LTAG-spinal provides a very desirable resource for statistical LTAG parsing, incremental parsing, dependency parsing, and semantic parsing. This treebank has been successfully used to train an incremental LTAG-spinal parser and a bidirectional LTAG dependency parser.

We compare our model of unsupervised learning of linguistic structures, ADIOS [1], to some recent work in computational linguistics and in grammar theory. Our approach resembles the Construction Grammar in its general philosophy (e.g., in its reliance on structural generalizations rather than on syntax projected by the lexicon, as in the current generative theories), and the Tree Adjoining Grammar in its computational characteristics (e.g., in its apparent afﬁnity with Mildly Context Sensitive Languages). The representations learned by our algorithm are truly emergent from the (unannotated) corpus data, whereas those found in published works on cognitive and construction grammars and on TAGs are hand-tailored. Thus, our results complement and extend both the computational and the more linguistically oriented research into language acquisition. We conclude by suggesting how empirical and formal study of language can be best integrated.

We describe a linguistic pattern acquisition algorithm that learns, in an unsupervised fashion, a streamlined representation of corpus data. This is achieved by compactly coding recursively structured constituent patterns, and by placing strings that have an identical backbone and similar context structure into the same equivalence class. The resulting representations constitute an efﬁcient encoding of linguistic knowledge and support systematic generalization to unseen sentences

This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised learning of syntactic analyses of natural language text. Most previous work has focused on maximizing likelihood according to generative PCFG models. In contrast, we employ a simpler probabilistic model over trees based directly on constituent identity and linear context, and use an EM-like iterative procedure to induce structure. This method produces much higher quality analyses, giving the best published results on the ATIS dataset.

The "surge in use of finite-state methods" ([10]) in computational linguistics has largely, if not completely, left semantics untouched. The present paper is directed towards correcting this situation. Techniques explained in [1] are applied to a fragment of temporal semantics through an approach we call finite-state temporality. This proceeds from the intuition of an event as "a series of snapshots" ([15]; see also [12]), equating snapshots with symbols that collectively form our alphabet. A sequence of snapshots then becomes a string over that alphabet, evoking comic/film strips. Jackendoff has, among others, objected to conceptualizing events in terms of snapshots ([8]). To counter these objections, we step up from events-as-strings to event-typesas-regular languages ([5, 6]), recognizing the need for variable granularity. Beyond the introduction of disjunction implicit in the step from a single string up to a set of strings, we obtain a useful logic from the regular operations and a careful choice of the snapshots (constituting our alphabet).

Both formal semantics and cognitive semantics are the source of important insights about language. By developing precise statements of the rules of meaning in fragmentary, abstract languages, formalists have been able to offer perspicuous accounts of how we might come to know such rules and use them to communicate with others. Conversely, by charting the overall landscape of interpretations, cognitivists have documented how closely interpretations draw on the commonsense knowledge that lets us make our way in the world. There is no opposition between these insights. Sooner or later we will have a semantics that responds to both. However, developing such a semantics is profoundly difficult, because there are certain tensions to be overcome in reconciling the two perspectives. For one thing, the overall landscape of meaning does seem to be characterized by a much richer ontology and more dynamic categories than are exhibited by the fragments typically studied in the formal tradition. One sign of strain is the recent tendency to talk of "procedural", "non-compositional", or "computational" semantics, as in Hamm, Kamp and van Lambalgen 2006, hereafter HK&vL. We think such locutions can serve as useful reminders to keep semantics fixed on the central question of how language allows us to share information that some have and others need to get. However, there is some danger that formalists will merely by put off by an idea that, taken literally, may not be such a good one. In this short article, we want to explore and defend the traditional realist view attributed by HK&vL to Lewis among others. In fact, this view offers a well-developed, extremely straightforward and robust account of the relation between semantics and cognition. Moreover, while the realist view has ways of accommodating the representationalist insights of DRT (Lewis 1979; Thomason 1990; Stalnaker 1998), it remains unclear how "computational" semantics can account for the key data for the realist view: cases where we judge interlocutors to be ignorant about aspects of meaning in their native language (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975; Stalnaker 1979; Williamson 1994)..

An essential ingredient of language use is our ability to reason about utterances as intentional actions. Linguistic representations are the natural substrate for such reasoning, and models from computational semantics can often be seen as providing an infrastructure to carry out such inferences from rich and accurate grammatical descriptions. Exploring such inferences offers a productive pragmatic perspective on problems of interpretation, and promises to leverage semantic representations in more flexible and more general tools that compute with meaning.

When modelling complex systems one can not include all the causal factors, but one has to settle for partial models. This is alright if the factors left out are either so constant that they can be ignored or one is able to recognise the circumstances when they will be such that the partial model applies. The transference of knowledge from the point of application to the point of learning utilises a combination of recognition and inference ­ a simple model of the important features is learnt and later situations where inferences can be drawn from the model are recognised. Context is an abstraction of the collection of background features that are later recognised. Different heuristics for recognition and model formulation will be effective for different learning tasks. Each of these will lead to a different type of context. Given this, there are (at least) two ways of modelling context: one can either attempt to investigate the contexts that arise out of the heuristics that a particular agent actually applies (the `internal' approach); or (if this is feasible) one can attempt to model context using the external source of regularity that the heuristics exploit. There are also two basic methodologies for the investigation of context: a top-down (or `foundationalist') approach where one tries to lay down general, a priori principles and a bottom-up (or `scientific') approach where one can try and find what sorts of context arise by experiment and simulation. A simulation is exhibited which is designed to illustrate the practicality of the bottom-up approach in elucidating the sorts of internal context that arise in an artificial agent which is attempting to learn simple models of a complex environment. It ends with a plea for the cooperation of the AI and Machine Learning communities as both learning and inference is needed if context is to make complete sense.

Some recent studies in computational linguistics have aimed to take advantage of various cues presented by punctuation marks. This short survey is intended to summarise these research efforts and additionally, to outline a current perspective for the usage and functions of punctuation marks. We conclude by presenting an information-based framework for punctuation, influenced by treatments of several related phenomena in computational linguistics.

Unsupervised grammar induction systems commonly judge potential constituents on the basis of their effects on the likelihood of the data. Linguistic justiﬁcations of constituency, on the other hand, rely on notions such as substitutability and varying external contexts. We describe two systems for distributional grammar induction which operate on such principles, using part-of-speech tags as the contextual features. The advantages and disadvantages of these systems are examined, including precision/recall trade-offs, error analysis, and extensibility.

In this article, robust evidence is provided showing that an individual's moral character can contribute to the aesthetic quality of their appearance, as well as being beautiful or ugly itself. It is argued that this evidence supports two main conclusions. First, moral beauty and ugliness reside on the inside, and beauty and ugliness are not perception-dependent as a result; and, second, aesthetic perception is affected by moral information, and thus moral beauty and ugliness are on the outside as well.

An artwork in one culture and form, say European classical music, cannot be evaluated in the context of another, say Hindustani music. While a person educated in the traditions of European music can rationally evaluate and discuss her response to a string quartet by Beethoven, her response to music in a foreign culture is merely subjective. She might "like" the latter, but her response is merely subjective. In this paper, I discuss the role of artforms: why response can be "objectively" discussed within artforms, but is nonetheless subjective across them. My discussion falls into two parts. First, I offer a psychological account of aesthetic response to art: cultural learning stabilizes this response across individuals who are educated in an artform. Second, I offer a cultural-evolutionary account of the diversity of artforms, adapting Darwin's Principle of the Divergence of Character to explain the multiplicity of art forms.

Peter Kivy claims that expressivists in aesthetics cannot explain why we argue about art. The situation would be different in the case of morals. Moral attitudes lead to action, and since actions affect people, we have a strong incentive to change people's moral attitudes. This can explain why we argue about morals, even if moral language is expressive of our feelings. However, judgements about what is beautiful and elegant need not significantly affect our lives. So why be concerned with other people's feelings about art? Kivy thinks the best explanation of our tendency to argue about art is that we implicitly believe in objective facts about aesthetics. This would count against expressivism. I argue two things: that there is no good reason to think that we don't care about preferences and emotions unless they have significant practical consequences and that the truth of expressivism about aesthetic language is compatible with beliefs about objective aesthetic facts.

Many people accept, at least implicitly, what I call the asymmetry claim: the view that moral realism is more defensible than aesthetic realism. This article challenges the asymmetry claim. I argue that it is surprisingly hard to find points of contrast between the two domains that could justify their very different treatment with respect to realism. I consider five potentially promising ways to do this, and I argue that all of them fail. If I am right, those who accept the asymmetry claim have a significant burden of proof.

In this essay, I'll argue, first, that an art object's aesthetic value (or merit) depends not just on its intrinsic properties, but on the response it evokes from a consumer who shares the producer's cultural background. My question is: what is the role of culture in relation to this response? I offer a new account of aesthetic pleasure that answers this question. On this account, aesthetic pleasure is not just a "feeling" or "sensation" that results from engaging with a work of art. It is rather a mental state that facilitates engagement with an artwork, and (in the long run) enables a consumer to learn how to maximize this kind of pleasure. This is where culture comes in. If you belong to a culture, you know how to engage pleasurably with an artwork that is produced so you can engage with it in just this way. The aesthetic value of an artwork is that it plays into such a culture-pleasure nexus.

The arguments of each chapter demonstrate that there is no neutral perspective from which to analyse aesthetic qualities. Such qualities cannot be described as their very perception involves evaluation. In short, the chapters focus on those aspects of a first person perspective that can be considered inter-personal in the sense that they are susceptible of intentional calibration and enculturation. That said, not all chapters approach the theme from the same perspective nor with the same targets in mind. For example, approaching the notion of inter-subjectivity with the intention of defending this possibility against the objection of relativism will yield a different treatment than championing inter-subjectivity in order to reject cultural arrogance, or overly reductive analyses of aesthetic qualities. Yet all chapters converge on the possibility of objectivity grounded in inter-subjectivity.

Scientific realists argue that a good track record of multi-agent, and multiple method, validation of empirical claims is itself evidence that those claims, at least partially and approximately, reflect ways nature actually is independent of the ways we conceptualize it. Constructivists contend that successes in validating empirical claims only suffice to establish that our ways of modelling the world, our "constructions," are useful and adequate for beings like us. This essay presents a thought experiment in which beings like us intersubjectively validate claims about properties of particular things in nature under conditions in which those beings have profoundly different personal phenomenological experiences of those properties. I submit that the thought experiment scenario parallels our actual situation, and argue that this shows that successes in intersubjectively validating empirical claims are indeed enough to claim victory for the realist. More specifically, I champion a variation of realism that marries Ronald Giere's brand of 'perspectival realism' with Philip Kitcher's 'real realism,' and posits that causal relations between ourselves and properties instantiated in nature ground our references to the relevant properties even though our conceptions of them are perspective relative.

The sublime is an aspect of experience that has attracted a great deal of scholarship, not only for scholarly reasons but because it connotes aspects of experience not exhausted by what Descartes once called clear distinct perception. That is, the sublime is an experience of the world which involves us in orientating ourselves within it, and this orientation, our human orientation, elevates us in comparison to the non-human world according to traditional accounts of the sublime. The sublime tells us something about our relation to the world rather than anything about the world per se. Nonetheless there is an objective sense of the sublime in that the narratives involved are culturally endorsed rather than invented by an individual. This means that objects can be judged worthy or not of evoking experiences of the sublime. In other words, it is not an idiosyncratic matter. Immanuel Kant's formulation of this involved explaining how such an experience is possible in terms of his system of the mind. Jane Forsey notes that Kant takes the features of the sublime as given and extrapolates from them certain features of the mind as if any concept of the sublime must implicate the mental architecture of his account (2007). Further to this she argues that in fact the concept of the sublime does implicate a particular system of the mind but neither Kant nor anyone else can successfully formulate it because the concept itself frames certain contradictions. According to Forsey, two consequences follow. First she argues that Kant's system of the mind does not support the features of the sublime; and secondly that no system could as the very concept is incoherent. If Forsey can show that Kant was mistaken in presenting his account as coherent given his commitments, this would be of interest in its own right. However, her stronger claim is that we cannot separate any concept of the sublime out from Kant's theoretical underpinnings. That the way the features of the mind are meant to operate in experiences of the sublime are contradictory simply points to the fatal flaws in the whole concept. Her conclusion is that there is no coherent account of the sublime available to us. I will argue that Forsey bases her reasoning on the assumption that a foundational empiricist or direct perception holds; and she interprets Kant's notions of imagination, understanding and reason as though they are grounded in just such an account of perception. This is revealed in her interpretation of Kant's phrase "beyond cognition". Once this foundationalism is replaced with an account of perception more aligned with current research on perception, both philosophical and empirical, then an account of the sublime is available. Further to this however, I argue that what constitutes the narrative of the sublime is historically contingent. Before setting out my arguments, I consider Forsey's argument in more detail.

Zombie art, or salvage art, are artworks that are damaged beyond repair, deemed by insurance companies, and removed from the market and stored at claims inventories due to their purported loss of value. This paper aims to make sense of the notion of zombie art. It then aims to determine whether artefacts that fall under this concept retain any aesthetic value, and whether they can genuinely cease being artworks, i.e. be dead art

Once we have distinguished between beauty and aesthetic value, we are faced with the question of whether beauty is a thing of value in itself. A number of theorists have suggested that the answer might be no. They have thought that the pursuit of beauty is just the indulgence of one particular taste: a taste that has, for contingent historical reasons, been privileged. This paper attempts to resist a line of thought that leads to that conclusion. It does so by arguing that there really are objective facts about beauty. To do this, the paper draws distinctions between objectivity and subjectivity, and between realism and anti-realism. It argues that, regarding attributions of beauty, we should be realists and objectivists. This is shown to be compatible with taking the semantic content of such attributions to vary between contexts. This form of context sensitivity is able to account of those features of beauty-attributions that have been taken as evidence for its subjectivity.

Noël Carroll proposes a generalist theory of art criticism, which essentially involves evaluations of artworks on the basis of their success value, at the cost of rendering evaluations of reception value irrelevant to criticism. In this article, I argue for a hybrid account of art criticism, which incorporates Carroll's objective model but puts Carroll-type evaluations in the service of evaluations of reception value. I argue that this hybrid model is supported by Kant's theory of taste. Hence, I not only present an alternative theory of metacriticism, which has the merit of reinstating the centrality of reception value in art critics' evaluations, but also show that, contrary to a common conception, Kant's aesthetic theory can house a fruitful account of art criticism. The benefit of this hybrid account is that, despite being essentially particularist, it should be appealing even to generalists, including Carroll.

Quine's desert is generally contrasted with Meinong's jungle, as a sober ontological alternative to the exuberant luxuriance that comes with the latter. Here I focus instead on the desert as a sober metaphysical alternative to the Aristotelian garden, with its tidily organized varieties of flora and fauna neatly governed by fundamental laws that reflect the essence of things and the way they can be, or the way they must be. In the desert there are no "natural joints"; all the boundaries we find are lines we have drawn, artificial fencings that merely reflect of our own demarcations, our classifications, our desperate need to ward off the flux and meet an excusable but ungrounded demand for order and stability. The desert returns a picture of reality that is radically anti-realist. And yet the picture does not amount to a form of irrealism. The desert is out there and is what it is regardless of how we feel. And it is not completely structureless. It's just that the structure it has is very thin and does not correspond to the sort of structure that so-called metaphysical realists—and scientific realists alike—tend to attribute to it.

Ontology is the study of what exists and the nature of the most fundamental categories into which those existents fall. Ontologists oﬀer a map of reality, one divided into such broad, overlapping territories as physical and mental, concrete and abstract, universal and particular. Such a map provides the setting for further philosophical investigation. Ontologists of art seek to locate works of art in this wider terrain, to say where in our universe they ﬁt in. Their governing question is, thus, "What kind of thing is a work of art?".

We challenge an argument that aims to support Aesthetic Realism by claiming, first, that common sense is realist about aesthetic judgments because it considers that aesthetic judgments can be right or wrong, and, second, that becauseAesthetic Realism comes from and accounts for "folk aesthetics," it is the best aesthetic theory available.We empirically evaluate this argument by probing whether ordinary people with no training whatsoever in the subtle debates of aesthetic philosophy consider their aesthetic judgments as right or wrong. Having shown that the results do not support the main premise of the argument, we discuss the consequences for Aesthetic Realism and address possible objections to our study.

My starting assumption concerns the default view in western aestethics. My claim is that the view can be characterized in the following manner: while the arts and religious experience are formally different kinds of human experience, the arts have the same content of religious experience (Essentialist claim, EC). I argue that both from a realist and antirealist standpoint EC does not make sense. Consequently, EC should be rejected as the right approach to the relation between the arts and religious experience.

The prevalence of colourful metaphors and figurative language in critics' descriptions of artworks has long attracted attention. Talk of 'liquid melodies', 'purple prose', 'soaring arches', and the use of still more elaborate figurative descriptions, is not uncommon. My aim in this paper is to explain why metaphor is so prevalent in critical description. Many have taken the prevalence of art-critical metaphors to reveal something important about aesthetic experience and aesthetic properties. My focus is different. I attempt to determine what metaphor enables critics to achieve and why it is so well suited to helping them achieve it. I begin by outlining my account of what metaphors communicate and defend it against objections to the effect that it does not apply to art-critical metaphors. I then distinguish between two kinds of art-critical metaphor. This distinction is not normally drawn, but drawing it is essential to understanding why critics use metaphor. I then explain why each kind of metaphor is so common in criticism.

The mythic Snuff film has remained a persistent cinematic rumour since the mid-1970s. The discourses that surround Snuff are preoccupied by two factors: (a) the formal aesthetic, and (b) their alleged role as a kind of titillating pornography. Although critical narratives have been established to account for the subgenre, little has been done to unpick a recent wave of hardcore horror pseudo-Snuff texts, and the cultural climate they enter into. Exploring the August Underground trilogy (2001-2007) in particular, I investigate how contemporary faux-Snuff fits into and challenges Snuff's established rhetorical paradigms. This discussion is informed by the legacy of 1970s anti-porn feminism as well as the age of reality culture, torture porn, and extreme pornography that immediately situates 21st century hardcore horror.

Aesthetic properties are often thought to have either no evaluative component or an evaluative component that can be isolated from their descriptive component. The present article argues that this popular view is without adequate support. First, doubt is cast on the idea that some paradigmatic aesthetic properties are purely descriptive. Second, the idea that the evaluative component of an aesthetic property can always be neatly separated from its descriptive component is called into question. Meanwhile, a speculative hypothesis is launched regarding the structure of being garish and being cacophonous. Finally, an explanation is given of how the issue of the structure of aesthetic properties bears on their reality and (presumed) response-dependence.

Interested in art, we tend to be interested in works of art. We seem to encounter works of art all the time, and—setting aside certain relatively abstruse problems in ontology—we seem to have little difficulty in recognizing them for what they are. That there are works of art seems obvious and unproblematic. Quite so, I think. But reflection on what has to be the case if there are to be works of art shows that some quite demanding conditions have to be met. Some will find those conditions too demanding: if I am right, that means that they should not admit that there are any works of art, and they will have to give some other account of what might be involved when we think we are dealing with a work of art. For myself, I think the conditions are not too demanding: their interest comes in what they show us about the nature of artistic 'media', and about what is involved in being a great artist.

According to Roy Sorensen [Philosophical Studies 100 (2000) 175–191] an object cannot differ aesthetically from its mirror image. On his view, mirror-reversing an object – changing its left/right orientation – cannot bring about any aesthetic change. However, in arguing for this thesis Sorensen assumes that aesthetic properties supervene on intrinsic properties alone. This is a highly controversial assumption and nothing is offered in its support. Moreover, a plausible weakening of the assumption does not improve the argument. Finally, Sorensen's second argument is shown to be formally flawed. As a result, the case for the aesthetic irrelevancy of orientation seems still open.

Stecker's revised definition of art in Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value is stated thus: "w is a work of art at t if and only if (a) w has form c which is a member of C and the maker of w intended it to fulfill a sub-set of functions f1 ... fn of F such that f1 ... fn are functions of c or (b) w is an object which achieves excellence in fulfilling a function in F" 1 where: w is an artwork; t is a time; C is the set of central art forms at t; c is a member of the set C; F is the set of functions standardly or correctly regarded as belonging to C at t; f1 ... fn are members of the set F.

Among the book's arguments: Aesthetic property relativism, as described by Alan Goldman, requires subjects to make judgments based on prima facie preferences for determinable properties (eg being curved, being blue). These judgments are not bona fide because they do not require acquaintance with objects. Value concepts and aesthetic (thick) concepts relate contingently. We can be aesthetic property realists, or quasi-realists, without being aesthetic value realists. Contains epistemological arguments against neuro-aesthetics (Ramachandran), aesthetic sense theory (Hutcheson), physiological theories (Burke), and Hume's realism.

Roger Scruton appears to have been the first to argue for and articulate an anti-realist theory of aesthetic properties. In the case of emotional qualities of music, his principal argument against realism is unsound and cannot, I believe, be repaired. Nevertheless an anti-realist view of emotional qualities of music is in my view correct and I defend Scruton's insight against a rival realist conception. However, I prefer a rather different form of anti-realism to Scruton's.

on great currency in analytic philosophical aesthetics. What is not generally known is that the American philosopher Eli Siegel called the philosophy he founded in the 1940s Aesthetic Realism. His philosophy has as its central principle: 'The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Thus, two distinct uses of the same terminology exist, and should not be confused.

Aesthetic realism is offered as a way of overcoming aesthetic disagreement and combating all forms of subjectivism, emotivism, and so on, with its thesis that aesthetic qualities really exist and the judgements about them are genuine statements of fact. This paper questions the intelligibility of that thesis together with its claim that aesthetic qualities are supervenient upon non-aesthetic ones. It is suggested that in this context supervenience amounts to little more than aspect perception and that allows ontological claims about supervenient qualities to be rejected. Subjectivism, however, is not the alternative. Neither realism nor subjectivism do justice to the complexity of aesthetic judgements and the roles that they play in our lives. It is suggested that the nature of these judgements is best pursued through Wittgenstein's notions of aspect perception and imponderable evidence.

I shall discuss several related issues about beauty. These are: (1) The place of beauty among other aesthetic properties. (2) The general principle of aesthetic supervenience. (3) The problem of aesthetic relevance. (4) The distinction between free and dependent beauty. (5) The primacy of our appreciation of free beauty over our appreciation of dependent beauty. (6) Personal beauty as a species of beauty. (7) The metaphysics of beauty.

"J'aime ce livre" serait une proposition insignifiante. L'artiste: un prétexte. On en parle, certes, mais dans une perspective de déconstruction. L'art, donc, plutôt comme expression de la vie. Et la vie comme art de la fuite révolutionnaire. Certains auteurs sont cités à satiété, certains passages sont repris textuellement, répétion aussi des mêmes thèmes, des mêmes expressions. Et une impasse fondamentale. "J'aime ce livre est en effet une proposition insignifiante.Tout propos portant sur le passé, dire "je t'aime", c'est dire qu'en ce moment je ne t'aime pas. Mais si aimer, écrire et vivre constituent "un même combat", et si dire l'amour n'est pas aimer, comment écrire la vie serait-il vivre? Et que pourrait bien signifier la proposition "Je n'aime pas ce livre"?

In this article I give a naturalistic-cum-formal analysis of the relation between beauty, empirical success, and truth. The analysis is based on the one hand on a hypothetical variant of the so-called 'mere-exposure effect' which has been more or less established in experimental psychology regarding exposure-affect relationships in general and aesthetic appreciation in particular (Zajonc 1968; Temme 1983; Bornstein 1989; (Ye 2000). On the other hand it is based on the formal theory of truthlikeness and truth approximation as presented in my From Instrumentalism to Constructive Realism (2000). The analysis supports the findings of James McAllister in his beautiful Beauty and Revolutiorl in Science (1996), by explaining and justifying them. First, scientists are essentially right in regarding aesthetic criteria useful for empirical progress and even for truth approximation, provided they conceive of them as less hard than empirical criteria. Second, the aesthetic criteria of the time, the 'aesthetic canon', may well be based on 'aesthetic induction' regarding nonempirical features of paradigms of successful theories which scientists have come to appreciate as beautiful. Third, aesthetic criteria can play a crucial, schismatic role in scientific revolutions. Since they may well be wrong, they may, in the hands of aesthetic conservatives, retard empirical progress and hence truth approximation, but this does not happen in the hands of aesthetically flexible, 'revolutionary' scientists

Thesis: Art like science radically affects our perceiving and thinking, and the two are substantially alike in that together--along with an inherited "natural" language system with which they overlap--they enable us to articulate the world. Science has been advanced as the measure of all things: scientific realism. By implication, art pertains to beauty, science truth. Science effects conceptual break-throughs, changes our models of natural order. On the contrary (I argue), as a nonverbal symbol system art similarly affects paradigm-induced expectations. Substantively there is no difference in the way each enables us to articulate or measure the world: symbolic realism. The myth of resemblance as a criterion of representation--imitation as a one-one relation--has, at least since the time of Plato, obscured this truth. Once the distinction between representational and nonrepresentational art falls, the true nature of artist (like scientist) as maker is illumined. The artist, the scientist (disciplinarian), the cosmologist (those responsible for the formulation of so-called natural languages--in time all of us) make the world or, what practically amounts to the same thing, the known, perceived world. This is the claim of the symbolic realist. Is symbolic realism itself only a watershed? What implication does this critique have for assessing the role of the philosopher today?

Ingarden (1962, 1964) postulates that artworks exist in an "Objective purely intentional" way. According to this view, objectivity and subjectivity are opposed forms of existence, parallel to the opposition between realism and idealism. Using arguments of cognitive science, experimental psychology, and semiotics, this lecture proposes that, particularly in the aesthetic phenomena, realism and idealism are not pure oppositions; rather they are aspects of a single process of cognition in different strata. Furthermore, the concept of realism can be conceived as an empirical extreme of idealism, and the concept of idealism can be conceived as a pre-operative extreme of realism. Both kind of systems of knowledge are mutually associated by a synecdoche, performing major tasks of mental order and categorisation. This contribution suggests that the supposed opposition between objectivity and subjectivity, raises, first of all, a problem of translatability, more than a problem of existential categories. Synecdoche seems to be a very basic transaction of the mind, establishing ontologies (in the more Ingardean way of the term). Wegrzecki (1994, 220) defines ontology as "the central domain of philosophy to which other its parts directly or indirectly refer". Thus, ontology operates within philosophy as the synecdoche does within language, pointing the sense of the general into the particular and/or viceversa. The many affinities and similarities between different sign systems, like those found across the interrelationships of the arts, are embedded into a transversal, synecdochic intersemiosis. An important question, from this view, is whether Ingardean's pure objectivities lie basically on the impossibility of translation, therefore being absolute self-referential constructions. In such a case, it would be impossible to translate pure intentionality into something else, like acts or products.

The aim of this work is to account for expressions like "Cantor's diagonal proof is elegant" or "Euler identity is the most beautiful formula of mathematics". This type of expressions is common among mathematicians; however, they may result in two kinds of puzzled reactions: first, the non mathematician may find the use of the word 'beautiful' strange in this context. Second, the mathematician may try to reinterpret mathematical beauty in terms of the principles and precepts of mathematics itself. I present an account of mathematical beauty that offers a way to avoid these puzzled reactions: mathematical beauty is just a type of "normal" beauty and no reinterpretation is necessary. To support this claim, I devise an aesthetic theory -by using insights and findings from experimental psychology, neurology, philosophical and psychological theories of emotion in art, philosophy of music and philosophy of science- that shows that aesthetic judgments in mathematics are genuine aesthetic judgments.
